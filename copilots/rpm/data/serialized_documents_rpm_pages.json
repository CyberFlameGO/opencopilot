Today, most of those experiences are closed and disconnected walled gardens.\n\nReady Player Me is a cross-game avatar platform for \u00a0developers , creators and players.

We operated our scanners in public places like airports, museums, and conference halls around the world.\n\nScan library\n\nWe scanned more than 20,000 people and collected a massive database of high-quality face scans in the process.\u2028\u2028This proprietary database of face scans allowed us to build a deep-learning solution that creates perfect virtual avatars from a single selfie on any device.\n\nBuilt on strong partnerships\n\nWe spent 4 years custom building avatar systems and avatar tech for enterprise customers like Tencent, Huawei, HTC, Wargaming, Verizon and many others.\n\nReinventing avatars\n\nWe launched Ready Player Me in 2020 with the aim of becoming the default avatar system for the builders, creators and residents of the metaverse.",
