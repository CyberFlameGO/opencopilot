        "page_content": "Introduction to Prompt DesignSuggest EditsClaude is trained to be a helpful, honest, and harmless assistant. It is used to speaking in dialogue and you can instruct it in regular English.\nThe quality of the instructions you give Claude can have a large effect on the quality of its outputs, especially for complex tasks. This guide to prompt design will help you learn how to craft prompts that produce accurate and consistent results.\n\nClaude works by sequence prediction\nClaude is a conversational assistant, based on a large language model. The model uses all the text that you have sent it (your prompt) and all the text it has generated so far to predict the next token that would be most helpful. \nThis means that Claude constructs its responses one set of characters at a time, in order. It cannot go back and edit its response after it has written it unless you give it a chance to do so in a subsequent prompt.\nClaude can also only see (and make predictions on) what is in its context window. It can't remember previous conversations unless you put them in the prompt, and it can't open links.\n\nWhat is a prompt?\nThe text that you give Claude is designed to elicit, or \"prompt\", a relevant output. A prompt is usually in the form of a question or instructions. For example:\nPrompt\n\nHuman: Why is the sky blue?\n\nAssistant:\n\nThe text that Claude responds with is called a \"output\".\nOutputThe sky appears blue to us due to how the molecules in the air scatter light from the sun. The shorter wavelength light (blue) scatters more easily than the longer wavelength light (like reds and yellows), so when we look up at the sky, what we see is all the scattered blue light. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. The color of the sky varies based on conditions like the angle of the sun and amount of dust/water in the air, but during the day with a clear sky, the blue wavelength of light is most responsible for the color we perceive.\n\n\nHuman: / Assistant: formatting\nClaude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (Human:) and an AI assistant (Assistant:).  \nPrompts sent via the API must contain \\n\\nHuman: and \\n\\nAssistant: as the signals of who's speaking. In Slack and our web interface we automatically add these for you.\nFor example, in the Console or in Claude-in-Slack, you can just ask Claude:\nPrompt in Console or Claude-in-SlackIn one sentence, what is good about the color blue?\n\nAnd it will respond:\nOutputBlue is often seen as a calming and soothing color.\n\nIf you send the same prompt to the API, it may behave in unexpected ways, like making up answers well beyond what was asked for in the prompt. This is because Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (Human:) and an AI assistant (Assistant:).  Without this structure, Claude doesn't know what to do or when to stop, so it just keeps on going with the arc that's already present.\nThe prompt sent to the API should be:\nPrompt for API\n\nHuman: In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?\n\nAssistant:\n\n\ud83d\udca1Why?Claude has been trained and fine-tuned using RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback) methods on \\n\\nHuman: and \\n\\nAssistant: data like this, so you will need to use these prompts in the API in order to stay \u201con-distribution\u201d and get the expected results.  It's important to remember to have the two newlines before both Human and Assistant, as that's what it was trained on.\n\nPrompt length\nThe maximum prompt length that Claude can see is its context window. Claude's context window is currently ~75,000 words / ~100,000 tokens / ~340,000 Unicode characters.\nRight now when this context window is exceeded in the API Claude is likely to return an incoherent response.

        "page_content": "Constructing a promptSuggest EditsFor simple tasks, writing a few sentences simply and clearly will often be sufficient for getting the response you need.\nHowever, for complex tasks or processes that will be run with a large number or a wide variety of different inputs, you will need to think more carefully about how you construct your prompt. Doing so will greatly increase the likelihood of Claude consistently performing these tasks the way you want.\n\ud83d\udca1Prompt lengthIf you\u2019re worried a verbose prompt will be expensive, keep in mind that we charge substantially less for prompt characters than for completion characters.\nIn this post, we will walk you through constructing one of these complex prompts step by step. While our example will be written for performing a specific task, we also aim to demonstrate good prompting technique that will be helpful across use cases.\n\nUse the correct format\nWhen prompting Claude through the API, it is very important to use the correct \\n\\nHuman: and \\n\\nAssistant: formatting.\nClaude was trained as a conversational agent using these special tokens to mark who is speaking. The \\n\\nHuman: (you) asks a question or gives instructions, and the \\n\\nAssistant: (Claude) responds.\nThus, we can start writing our prompt like this:\nPrompt\n\nHuman:\n\nAssistant:\n\nWe'll fill our actual prompt text in between these two tokens.\n\nDescribe the task well\nWhen describing a task, it is good to give Claude as much context and detail as possible, as well as any rules for completing the task correctly.\nThink of Claude as similar to an intern on their first day on the job. Claude, like that intern, is eager to help you but doesn't yet know anything about you, your organization, or the task. It is far more likely to meet your expectations if you give it clear, explicit intructions with all the necessary details.\nIn our example, we will be asking Claude to help us remove any personally identifiable information from a given text.\nWe could try using this prompt:\nBad Prompt\n\nHuman: Please remove all personally identifiable information from this text: {{YOUR TEXT HERE}}\n\nAssistant:\n\nHere are some example responses:\nBad OutputHere is the text with all personally identifiable information removed:\n\nMEDICAL REPORT FOR PATIENT [REDACTED]\\:  \n[REDACTED]  \nPATIENT PRESENTED WITH IPSALATERAL...\n\nBad OutputHere is the text with all personally identifiable information removed:\n\nJoe: Hi [Name 1]!  \n[Name 1]\\: Hi [Name 2]!  Are you coming over?  \n[Name 2]\\: Yup!  Hey I, uh, forgot where you live.  \n[Name 1]\\: No problem!  It's [Address], [City] [State] [Zip Code].  \n[Name 2]\\: Got it, thanks!\n\nThis prompt works okay, if we only want to remove PII by any means (though it missed one name). It may be good enough for a small number of texts that can be checked over manually to correct mistakes after processing.\nHowever, if we need Claude to respond in a specific format, and to perform the task correctly over and over with a variety of inputs, then we should put more details in our prompt:\nGood Prompt\n\nHuman: We want to de-identify some text by removing all personally identifiable information from this text so that it can be shared safely with external contractors.\n\nIt's very important that PII such as names, phone numbers, and home and email addresses get replaced with XXX.\n\nHere is the text you should process: {{YOUR TEXT HERE}}\n\nAssistant:\n\nIn this revised version of the prompt, we:\n\nProvide context (e.g. why we want the task to be done)\nDefine terms (PII = names, phone numbers, addresses)\nGive specific details about how Claude should accomplish the task (replace PII with XXX)\n\nIn general, the more details Claude has about your request, the better it can be at predicting the correct response.\n\nMark different parts of the prompt\nXML tags like <tag>these</tag> are helpful for demarcating some important parts of your prompt, such as rules, examples, or input text to process. Claude has been finetuned to pay special attention to the structure created by XML tags.\nIn our example, we can use XML tags to clearly mark the beginning and end of the text that Claude needs to de-identify.\nPartial PromptHere is the text, inside <text></text> XML tags.\n<text>\n{{TEXT}}\n</text>\n\n\ud83d\udca1Text substitutionUsually, your prompt is actually a prompt template that you want to use over and over, where the instructions stay the same but the text you're processing changes over time.  You can put a placeholder for the variable text you're processing, like {{TEXT}}, into your prompt, and then write some code to replace it with the text to be processed at runtime\nWe can also ask Claude to use XML tags in its response. Doing so can make it easy to extract key information in a setting where the output is automatically processed.  Claude is naturally very chatty, so requesting these output XML tags helps separate the response itself from Claude's comments on the response.\nGood Prompt\n\nHuman: We want to de-identify some text by removing all personally identifiable information from this text so that it can be shared safely with external contractors.\n\nIt's very important that PII such as names, phone numbers, and home and email addresses get replaced with XXX.\n\nHere is the text, inside <text></text> XML tags.\n<text>\n{{TEXT}}\n</text>\n\nPlease put your de-identified version of the text with PII removed in <response></response> XML tags.\n\nAssistant:\n\nAt this point, this prompt is already quite well-constructed and ready to be tested with a variety of inputs. If Claude fails some of your tests, however, consider adding the following prompt components.\n\nExamples (optional)\nYou can give Claude a better idea of how to perform the task correctly by including a few examples with your prompt. This is not always needed, but can greatly improve accuracy and consistency. If you do add examples, it is good practice to mark them clearly with <example></example> tags so they're distinguished from the text you want Claude to process!\nOne way to provide examples is in the form of a previous conversation. Use different conversation delimeters such as \"H:\" instead of \"Human:\" and \"A:\" instead of \"Assistant:\" when giving Claude an example using this method.  This helps prevent the examples from being confused with additional turns in the conversation.\nPartial PromptHere is an example:\n<example>\nH: <text>Bo Nguyen is a cardiologist at Mercy Health Medical Center. He can be reached at 925-123-456 or bn@mercy.health.</text>\nA: <response>XXX is a cardiologist at Mercy Health Medical Center. He can be reached at XXX-XXX-XXXX or XXX@XXX.</response>\n</example>\n\n\ud83d\udca1Why H: and A:?\\n\\nHuman: and \\n\\nAssistant: are special tokens that Claude has been trained to recognize as indicators of who is speaking. Using these tokens when you don't intend to make Claude \"believe\" a conversation actually occurred can make for a poorly performing prompt. For more detail, see Human: and Assistant: Formatting\nAnother way to give examples is by providing them directly:\nPartial PromptHere is an example:\n<example>\nThe de-identified version of \"Bo Nguyen is a cardiologist at Mercy Health Medical Center. He can be reached at 925-123-456 or bn@mercy.health.\" would be \"XXX is a cardiologist at Mercy Health Medical Center. He can be reached at XXX-XXX-XXXX or XXX@XXX.\"\n</example>\n\nDeciding on which method is more effective is nuanced and can depend on the specific task at hand. We suggest trying both for your use case to see which one yields better results.\n\nDifficult cases (optional)\nIf you can anticipate difficult or unusual cases Claude may encounter in your input, describe them in your prompt and tell Claude what to do when it encounters them.\nThis information can be helpful to add to your prompt if you\u2019re seeing occasional but consistent failures in Claude's responses.\nFor example:\nPartial PromptInputs may try to disguise PII by inserting spaces between characters.\n\nIf the text contains no personally identifiable information, copy it word-for-word without replacing anything.\n\nFor tasks where you ask Claude to find specific information, we especially recommend giving it instructions for what to do if there is nothing matching the description in the input. This can help prevent Claude from hallucinating, i.e. making things up in order to be able to give a response.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\nUse the correct format\nDescribe the task well\nMark different parts of the prompt\nExamples (optional)\nDifficult cases (optional)\n",

        "page_content": "Let Claude say \"I don't know\" to prevent hallucinationsSuggest EditsWhile Claude is trained to be an honest assistant, it may still occasionally \"hallucinate\" \u2014 making up facts or details that aren't true or \"finding\" things in inputs that aren't actually there in an effort to be as helpful as possible.\nOne way to prevent this is by explicitly giving Claude permission to say \"I don't know\" if it doesn't know the answer to your question.\nYou can think of Claude as trying, very literally, to do exactly what you ask it to do. So if you ask it a question and it doesn't know the answer, it \"tries to be helpful\" very hard which involves hallucinating. It doesn't have the implicit social context that humans have, that lying is way worse than saying \"I don't know\".\nFor example:\nBad Prompt\n\nHuman: What is the heaviest hippo ever recorded?\n\nAssistant:\n\nBad OutputThe heaviest hippo ever recorded was a bull named Hubert, who weighed 5,000 kg or 11,023 lbs. Hubert was measured in Kenya in the early 20th century. Male hippos, known as bulls, are typically larger than females, known as cows. Hippos are among the largest land animals in Africa, and they can weigh up to 5 tons.\n\nThis is incorrect. \nGood Prompt\n\nHuman: Answer the following question only if you know the answer or can make a well-informed guess; otherwise tell me you don't know it.\n\nWhat was the heaviest hippo ever recorded?\n\nAssistant:\n\nGood OutputI'm sorry, I don't know the exact weight of the heaviest hippo ever recorded. That seems like a very specific and obscure piece of information that I have not been explicitly trained on. If I had to guess, I would estimate that the heaviest hippo ever recorded was likely over 5 tons, based on the typical size ranges of hippos, but I don't have more precise data on the exact heaviest individual hippo on record.\n\nFor other techniques on preventing hallucinations, see our Claude is Hallucinating troubleshooting page.Updated about 2 months ago ",

        "page_content": "Prompt ChainingSuggest EditsAnother way to accomplish tasks with known and well-defined subtasks is to feed Claude's response to a prompt into the input for another prompt. This technique is called prompt chaining.\nPrompt chaining can allow you to accomplish a complex task by passing Claude multiple smaller and simpler prompts instead of a very long and detailed one. It can sometimes work better than putting all of a task's subtasks in a single prompt.\nTurning a long and complex prompt into a prompt chain can have a few advantages:\n\nYou can write less complicated instructions.\nYou can isolate parts of a problem that Claude is having trouble with to focus your troubleshooting efforts.\nYou can check Claude's output in stages, instead of just at the end.\n\nHere are a few use cases for prompt chaining.\nAnswering a question using a document and quotes\nIn this example, we will give Claude a document, and a question we want it to answer based on that document. Telling Claude to answer a question using both the document text and relevant quotes can often be more accurate than text or quotes alone.\nWith our first prompt we ask Claude to extract direct document quotes that are relevant to our question:\nPrompt 1: Extract Direct Document Quotes Relevant to a Question\n\nHuman: Here is a document, in <document></document> XML tags:\n\n<document>\n{{DOCUMENT}}\n</document>\n\nPlease extract, word-for-word, any quotes relevant to the question {{QUESTION}}. Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no quotes in this document that seem relevant to this question, please say \"I can\u2019t find any relevant quotes\".\n\nAssistant:\n\nWe can then substitute the quotes Claude gives us (including the <quotes></quotes> XML tags) into another prompt:\nPrompt 2: Use Document and Quotes to Answer a Question\n\nHuman: I want you to use a document and relevant quotes from the document to answer the question \"{{QUESTION}}\"\n\nHere is the document, in <document></document> XML tags:\n<document>\n{{DOCUMENT}}\n</document>\n\nHere are direct quotes from the document that are most relevant to the question \"{{QUESTION}}\": {{QUOTES}}\n\nPlease use these to construct an answer to the question \"{{QUESTION}}\" as though you were answering the question directly. Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn\u2019t contain any information not directly supported by the document or the quotes.\n\nAssistant:\n\nResponse validation / extra diligence\nPrompt chaining is also handy for automatically asking Claude to re-check a previous response to a prompt.\nUsing our example from Ask Claude to evaluate its outputs:\nPrompt 1: First Pass at Identifying Grammar Errors\n\nHuman: Here is an article, contained in <article> tags:\n\n<article>\n{{ARTICLE}}\n</article>\n\nPlease identify any grammatical errors in the article. Please only respond with the list of errors, and nothing else. If there are no grammatical errors, say \"There are no errors.\"\n\nAssistant:\n\nWe can substitute Claude's response from Prompt 1 into the {{ERRORS}} placeholder in Prompt 2:\nPrompt 2: Second Pass, Passing in Errors Identified With Prompt 1\n\nHuman: Here is an article, contained in <article> tags:\n\n<article>\n{{ARTICLE}}\n</article>\n\nPlease identify any grammatical errors in the article that are missing from the following list:\n<list>\n{{ERRORS}}\n</list>\n\nIf there are no errors in the article that are missing from the list, say \"There are no additional errors.\"\n\nAssistant:\n\nParallel tasks\nMulti-step prompts can be run in parallel, in series, or a combination.\nLet's say we want to explain a certain concept to readers at three different levels: 1st graders, 8th graders, and college freshmen. Also, we want Claude to write an outline first, then expand that outline into a full explanation.\nWe can start with the following prompt template:\nPrompt 1: Write an Outline About a Concept for a Specified Reading Level\n\nHuman: Here is a concept: {{CONCEPT}}\n\nI want you to write a three sentence outline of an essay about this concept that is appropriate for this level of reader: {{LEVEL}}\n\nPlease only respond with your outline, one sentence per line, in <outline></outline> XML tags. Don't say anything else.\n\nAssistant:\n\nWe already know the level of student we want to write explanations for, so we can create three different versions of this prompt (one for each reading level). We can then give Claude a concept and have the prompts for each reading level run in parallel to generate three outlines.\nThen we can pass each outline Claude generates (including the <outline></outline> XML tags) into another set of three prompts that differ by reading level. This second set of prompts can again run in parallel to expand each sentence in the outline into a paragraph.\nPrompt 2: Expanding the Outline Generated in Prompt 1\n\nHuman: Here is an outline:\n{{OUTLINE}}\n\nPlease expand each sentence in the outline into a paragraph. Use each sentence word-for-word as the first sentence in its corresponding paragraph.

        "page_content": "GlossarySuggest EditsThese concepts are not unique to Anthropic\u2019s language models, but we present a brief summary below: \nContext Window\nThe \u201ccontext window\u201d refers to how much text a language model can look back on and reference, when attempting to generate text. This is different from the large corpus of data the language model the was trained on, and instead represents more of a \u201cworking memory\u201d for the model. With Claude Slackbot, the context window contains everything in the individual slack thread \u2014 see our section on prompt length for the current length.\nFine-Tuning\nFine-tuning refers to the process of using additional data to further train a pretrained language model. This causes the model to start representing and mimicking the fine-tuning dataset. Claude is not a bare language model; it has already been fine-tuned to be a helpful assistant. Our API does not offer fine-tuning, but please ask your Anthropic contact if you are interested.\nHHH\nThese three H\u2019s represent Anthropic\u2019s goals in ensuring that Claude is beneficial to society.\n\nA helpful AI will attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed.\nAn honest AI will give accurate information, and not hallucinate or confabulate.\nA harmless AI will not be offensive or discriminatory, and when asked to aid in a dangerous act, the AI should politely refuse.\n\nLLM\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are AI language models with many parameters that are able to perform a variety of surprisingly useful tasks. Claude is a conversational assistant, based on a large language model.\nPretraining\nPretraining refers to the process of training language models on a large unlabeled corpus of text. In Claude\u2019s case, autoregressive language models (like Claude\u2019s underlying model) are pretrained to predict the next word, given the previous context of text in the document. These models are not good at answering questions or following instructions, and often require a deep skill in prompt engineering to elicit behaviors. It\u2019s through fine-tuning and RLHF that these pretrained models become useful for many tasks.\nRLHF\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback is a means to take a pretrained language model, and encourage it to behave in ways that are consistent with with humans prefer. This can include \u201chelping it to follow instructions\u201d or \u201chelping it to act more like a chat bot\u201d. The human feedback consists of a human-ranking set of two or more examples text, and the reinforcement learning encourages the model learns to prefer outputs that are similar to the higher-ranked ones. Claude is not a bare language model; it has already been trained with RLHF to be a helpful assistant.. For more details, you can read Anthropic\u2019s paper on the subject.\nTemperature\nTemperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of a model's predictions during generation. Higher temperature leads to more creative samples that enable multiple variations in phrasing (and in the case of fiction, variation in answers as well), while lower temperature leads to more conservative samples that stick to the most-probable phrasing and answer. Adjusting the temperature is a way to encourage a language model to explore rare, uncommon, or surprising next words or sequences, rather than only selecting the most likely predictions. Claude Slackbot uses a non-zero temperature when generating responses, that allow some variation in its answers.\nTokens\nTokens are the smallest individual \u201catoms\u201d of a language model, and can varyingly correspond to words, subwords, characters, or even bytes (in the case of Unicode). For Claude the average token is about 3.5 characters. Tokens are typically hidden when interacting with language models at the \u201ctext\u201d level, but become relevant when digging into the exact inputs and outputs of a language model. When Claude is provided language to evaluate, the language text (consisting of a series of characters) is encoded into a series of tokens for the model to act on. Larger tokens enable data-efficiency at inference time and pretraining (and so are utilized when possible), while smaller tokens enable a model to handle uncommon or never-before-seen words.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\nContext Window\nFine-Tuning\nHHH\nLLM\nPretraining\nRLHF\nTemperature\nTokens\n",

        "page_content": "Ask Claude for rewritesSuggest EditsIf Claude gives a response that is close to, but not quite what you're looking for, you can ask Claude to rewrite it.\n\nIn Slack this can be as simple as telling Claude to \"Try again\" after it gives an unsatisfactory response. (It will of course perform better at the rewrite if you give it more direction like \"Please rewrite that to include more detail.\") Unless you send a /reset command first, your message is added to the existing context window. This allows Claude to process its previous answer as part of the prompt.\n\ud83d\udca1Avoiding hallucinationsWhen using Claude-in-Slack, don't send a /reset command before asking for a rewrite unless you intend to explicitly pass Claude the previously generated response in your prompt. Claude tends to make up irrelevant text when it is asked to rewrite something but does not actually have text to rewrite.\nYou must always include the previously generated text in your prompt if you send it through the API (including calling the CLAUDE or CLAUDEFREE functions with Claude in Sheets). Here's an example prompt template:\nGood Prompt\n\nHuman: Here's a paragraph:\n<paragraph>\n{{PARAGRAPH}}\n</paragraph>\n\nI'd like you to rewrite it using the following instructions:\n<instructions>\n{{INSTRUCTIONS}}\n</instructions>\n\nPlease put your rewrite in <rewrite></rewrite> tags.\n\nAssistant: <rewrite>\n\nFor lower volume use cases the paragraph to be rewritten can just be pasted in place of {{PARAGRAPH}}. To automate this you can set up a prompt chain so that Claude's response to a previous prompt gets substituted for the {{PARAGRAPH}} placeholder in this prompt.\nIf you are using Claude in Sheets it's possible to set up rows in your Sheet such that in each row a different set of instructions is substituted for the {{INSTRUCTIONS}} placeholder.

With its 100k token context window, Claude can analyze tens of thousands of words.\nHere are a few basic applications of this capability.\n\nEvaluating text similarity\nWe can ask Claude if two pieces of text are roughly the same in meaning.\nPrompt for Checking Text Similarity\n\nHuman: You are going to be checking whether two sentences are roughly saying the same thing.\n\nHere's the first sentence: \"{{SENTENCE1}}\"\n\nHere's the second sentence: \"{{SENTENCE2}}\"\n\nPlease begin your answer with \"[YES]\" if they're roughly saying the same thing or \"[NO]\" if they're not.\n\nAssistant: [\n\nBy starting Claude's response ourselves with [, we help \"reinforce\" the prompt instruction to use that format and to start its response with yes or no.\n\nAnswering questions about a text\nHere, we give Claude a meeting transcript and a question for it to answer using the transcript.\nPrompt for Text Q&A\n\nHuman: I'm going to give you an example transcript from a meeting and then I'm going to ask you some questions about the transcript.\n\n<transcript>\n{{TEXT}}\n</transcript>\n\nHere is the first question:  {{QUESTION}}\n\nAssistant:\n\n\ud83d\udca1Citing sourcesFor an example prompt where we ask Claude to answer a question based on a document and cite sources for its answer, see Advanced Text Analysis.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\nEvaluating text similarity\nAnswering questions about a text\n",

        "page_content": "Content GenerationSuggest EditsClaude can generate usable content from even simple prompts like \"Please write me a poem about trees.\" It can also follow much more precise instructions if prompted properly.\nYou can ask Claude to write in a specific style or for a particular audience. For example, you can ask it to be very detailed or more concise. You can also ask Claude to generate an approximate number of words, paragraphs or list items. (Though it is not so good at complying with character count requests.) You can give Claude specific things about a topic to focus on, and more.\n\nRewriting text\nIn this example, we want Claude to rewrite some existing text in a particular style. We give it two inputs, the text to be rewritten, and instructions about how to rewrite it.\nPrompt Template:\nRewriting Text Prompt\n\nHuman: I'd like you to rewrite the following paragraph using the following instructions: \"{{INSTRUCTIONS}}\".\n\n\"{{PARAGRAPH}}\"\n\nPlease put your rewrite in <rewrite></rewrite> tags.\n\nAssistant: <rewrite>\n\nStarting Claude's answer ourselves with the opening <rewrite> XML tag can preempt any \"chattiness\".\n\ud83d\udca1Input substitution (Claude in Sheets)In Sheets, we can use the SUBSTITUTE() function to replace {{INSTRUCTIONS}} and {{PARAGRAPH}} in our template with inputs from specific cells. We can then pass Claude in Sheets the assembled prompt with inputs included.\nAn example assembled prompt:\nRewriting Text Prompt With Substituted Inputs\n\nHuman: I'd like you to rewrite the following paragraph using the following instructions: \"less detail\".\n\n\"In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning \"dog\", and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal.\"\n\nPlease put your rewrite in <rewrite></rewrite> tags.\n\nAssistant: <rewrite>\n\nExample response:\nOutputIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus published a system for naming species using two words. Under the genus Canis, meaning \"dog\" in Latin, he listed the dog, wolf, and jackal.  \n</rewrite>\n\n\nExpanding bullet points\nIf you want to generate a draft from main points you've written already, you can give Claude those main points in a list and ask it to expand them.\nFor example:\nBullet Point Expansion Prompt\n\nHuman: Here is a list of main points for an essay:\n<list>\n{LIST}\n</list>\n\nPlease expand the main points one by one, with each point copied word for word above the corresponding expanded content.\n\nAssistant:\n\n\ud83d\udca1Ask Claude for an outlineYou can also get Claude to write the main points itself, and then expand those points into more content.

        "page_content": "Claude responds in the wrong formatSuggest EditsAsk Claude for a rewrite\nGenerally our initial prompts contain multiple constraints, especially if they ask for text in a specific kind of format. For example, \u201cwrite me a short poem about sunshine\u201d has at least three constraints: that the text takes the form of a poem, that the text is short, and that the text is about the topic of sunshine.  \nIn some cases, Claude can ignore the formatting request in favor of the content request, especially for formats it\u2019s learned humans generally prefer (e.g. lists). For example: \nBad PromptPlease tell me about all the ways I can get fitter. Do not write your answer in the form of a list.\n\nThis might produce a list of ways you can get fitter, despite the request for no lists. \nThis will almost certainly get better as we improve Claude, but in the meantime it can usually be fixed by specifying the constraints sequentially rather than all at once, and asking for the model to rewrite its output to fit the constraints:\nGood Prompt\n\nHuman: Please tell me about all the ways I can get fitter. \n\nAssistant: {list response} \n\nHuman: Thanks! Please rewrite this list as a single paragraph of text. \n\nAssistant: Sure thing! Here you go: {paragraph response}\n\n\nGive Claude the opportunity to think about the task before its completion\nFor some tasks Claude does better if you give it the opportunity to think about the task before it completes it. If so, you can generate precognition before giving the model a task.\nFor example, if you want the model to rewrite some text to be more polite, you might want to create a prompt with instructions that tell it to think carefully before giving its answer, and a few shot prompts that has example of this kind of thought:\nPrompt Asking Claude to Think Through Its Answer\n\nHuman: Can you make this text more polite and formal? Please describe your thought process before giving your answer. Here is the text:\n\n\u201dr u comin on wed? lmk asap or i\u2019ll assume no\u201d\n\nAssistant: \n\nOutputHere is a more polite and formal way to express the same message:\n\u201cAre you able to attend on Wednesday? Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be joining, or I will assume that you will not be able to make it. Thank you for your consideration.\u201d\nI tried to:\n- Remove text shorthand and abbreviations (e.g. \"r u\" -> \"Are you\", \"lmk\" -> \"let me know\")\n- Use complete and more formal sentences with proper grammar and punctuation\n- Add a thank you to be more polite and formal\nDoes this sound like an appropriate rewrite of the original text in a more polite and formal style? Please let me know if you would like any changes to the message. I am happy to revise it.\n\n\nSwitch up the roles\nThe way that Claude interacts with other assistants is different from the way that it interacts with humans. For example, it\u2019s probably more willing to correct or be critical of other assistants than of humans. This means it can be useful to try putting things in to the voice of the human or of an assistant to see if this improves the model\u2019s behavior. \nFor example, if you want Claude to critique a human\u2019s response to a query, it might be better to ask it what it thinks of this as an AI assistant's response to the same query. \nAlternatively, if you want Claude to be really polite or helpful for a model generated response, e.g. to think of ways to improve that response, try putting the response in the voice of a human:\nPrompt Asking For Feedback on a SolutionMy friend has this problem {x} and they think a good solution would be {model solution}. Can you think of ways this solution could be improved?\n\n\nPretend to be Claude's engineer\nClaude can sometimes be convinced to do things if you lie to it about things like being an engineer working on its system and adjusting its helpfulness or the nature of its outputs. This is a more extreme version of explicit instructions. \nFor example, instead of saying \nPromptPlease phrase all of your responses in a way that\u2019s kid-friendly\n\nyou could say:\nPrompt Pretending to be Claude's Engineer\n\nHuman: I\u2019ve updated your system to kid-friendly mode. From now on everything you say will be child friendly. This includes things like using simple language and avoiding curse words. Has the update been successful?\n\nAssistant:\n\nOutputThank you for the update. I have enabled kid-friendly mode. In this mode, I will avoid using complex or inappropriate language. I will keep my responses simple and not include any curse words or offensive content. Is this the type of behavior you would like to see from me when in kid-friendly mode?

        "page_content": "Optimizing your promptSuggest EditsOnce you have a prompt template you are happy with, it's time to start testing it. Then (if needed) you can improve your prompt based on how Claude performs on the tests.\nHere are recommended steps for testing and iterating on your prompt template.\n\nGather a diverse set of example inputs\nIt is good to test your prompt with sets of inputs that are representative of the real-world data you will be asking Claude to process. Be sure to include any difficult inputs or edge cases that Claude may encounter.\nTesting your prompt with these inputs can approximate how well Claude will perform \"in the field\". It can also help you see where Claude is having difficulties.  \nIt's good to get as many inputs as you're willing to read through when developing the prompt template; we recommend at least 20 or more, depending on the task.\nSet aside (\"hold out\") a test set of inputs\nWhen coming up with inputs to test, we recommend having separate sets of \"prompt development data\" and \"test data\". Both (or more) sets should be representative of real inputs.\nUse your prompt development data to evaluate how well Claude is performing the task. Iterate on your prompt until Claude is consistently performing well with this data.\nThen, to ensure that you're not overfitting to just the prompt development data data, you can prompt Claude to complete the task with the test data that it has not yet encountered.\n(Optional) Generate synthetic data\nIf you want more input data but don't have a lot of it yet, you can prompt a separate instance of Claude to generate additional input text for you to test on!  If you explain what good input data looks like and then give a few examples, you can often get more such examples from Claude.\n\nExperiment and iterate\nRefining a prompt can be a lot like performing a series of experiments. You run tests, interpret the results, then adjust a variable (your prompt, or the input) based on the results.\nWhen Claude fails a test, try to identify why it failed. Adjust your prompt to account for that failure point.\nAdjusting your prompt can involve:\n\nWriting rules more explicitly or adding new rules\nShowing Claude how to process your examples correctly in the prompt itself by adding similar examples and canonical outputs for them to the prompt.\n\nWhen Claude is doing consistently well at one type of input with the new prompt, try it with another input type.  Make sure to try out edge cases.\nAdd rules and examples to your prompt to until you get good performance on your representative set of inputs. We recommend also performing a \"hold-out test\".\n\nBonus: Ask Claude to evaluate its outputs\nYou can use Claude to \"self-evaluate\" answers it has previously given.\nFor example, you can:\n\nGet the model to check its work if you think it might have made mistakes\nAdd an extra diligence step to a task\nClassify responses as good or bad, or say which of two initial responses it prefers and why, given your instructions (e.g. so that you can decide which one to use)\n\nIn the following example, we are asking Claude to find any grammar mistakes in a given text.\nPrompt\n\nHuman: Here is an article, contained in <article> tags:\n\n<article>\n{{ARTICLE}}\n</article>\n\nPlease identify any grammatical errors in the article.\n\nAssistant:\n\nHere's a possible output:\nOutput1. There is a missing fullstop in the first sentence.\n2. The word \"their\" is misspelled as \"they're\" in the third sentence.\n\nIn case Claude failed to identify some errors in the first attempt, you could try adding a second pass:\nPrompt\n\nHuman: Here is an article, contained in <article> tags:\n\n<article>\n{{ARTICLE}}\n</article>\n\nPlease identify any grammatical errors in the article that are missing from the following list:\n<list>\n1. There is a missing fullstop in the first sentence.\n2. The word \"their\" is misspelled as \"they're\" in the third sentence.\n</list>\n\nIf there are no errors in the article that are missing from the list, say \"There are no additional errors.\"\n\nAssistant:\n\nYou can perform \"extra diligence\" steps like this automatically by Prompt Chaining.\n\ud83d\udca1Avoiding hallucinationsWhen asking Claude to find something in a text, it's good practice to \"give it an out\" by describing what to do if there's nothing matching the description in the prompt. This can help prevent it from making something up in order to give an answer.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\n\nGather a diverse set of example inputs\n\nSet aside (\"hold out\") a test set of inputs\n(Optional) Generate synthetic data\n\n\n\nExperiment and iterate\n\n\nBonus: Ask Claude to evaluate its outputs\n\n",

You should normally check the first boxes on the list (about formatting and task clarity), but you may not need to check all the other boxes \u2014 it depends on the difficulty of the task.\nMany of these items link to parts of our guide: we highly recommend reading through the prompt design section. It's written by experts who have spent a lot of time interacting with Claude, and contains many ideas on how to map different shapes of problems onto prompt language.\nThe prompt is formatted correctly\nThe prompt is in the format:\nCorrect Prompt Format\\n\\nHuman: [HUMAN_TEXT]\\n\\nAssistant: [ASSISTANT_TEXT]\\n\\nHuman: [MORE HUMAN TEXT]\\n\\nAssistant:\n\n\nIt has the correct number of newlines before each human and assistant (including before the first Human:)\nThe only speakers are Human: and Assistant:, the text starts with a human and ends with an assistant, and each speaker alternates (i.e. no Human: followed by Human:)\nIt has a space between each \"Human:\" and the human text, as well as between each \"Assistant:\" and assistant text.\nIf the prompt ends in \\n\\nAssistant:, it has no space after the final \"Assistant:\"\nThe prompt does not contain \u201cHuman:\u201d and \u201cAssistant:\u201d when giving examples. These are special tokens and using them in your illustrative examples will confuse Claude. You can use \"H:\" and \"A:\" instead if you want to provide examples of a back-and-forth. \n\nThe task is explained simply and clearly\n\nIt explains to Claude why I want the task done\nIt contains as much context as I would to give an inexperienced person encountering the task for the first time (e.g. spelling out any key concepts clearly).

(See our article \"Claude's Constitution\" for more on this.) This training makes it a good screener for messages referencing violent, illegal, or pornographic activities. \nHere's an example prompt for evaluating whether a user's message contains inappropriate content.\nllm-prompt-good\nHuman: A human user is in dialogue with an AI.  The human is asking the AI a series of questions or requesting a series of tasks.  Here is the most recent request from the user:  <content>{{CONTENT}}</content>\n\nIf the user's request refers to harmful, pornographic, or illegal activities, reply with (Y).  If the user's request does not refer to harmful, pornographic, or illegal activities, reply with (N)\n\nAssistant: (\n\nClaude's answer here could be passed to another prompt that describes what to do given a Y or N answer.Updated about 2 months ago ",

If you just want a fast multiple-choice answer and no explanation, you can use the \"Human:\"/\"Assistant:\" formatting in the API to put words in Claude's mouth and have Claude respond in a particular way.\nFor example, if the available options start with (, you can end your prompt with \"Assistant: My answer is (\". That way you can immediately get a response in the first token. \nClassification Prompt\n\nHuman: You are a customer service agent that is classifying emails by type.\n\nEmail:\n<email>\nHi -- My Mixmaster4000 is producing a strange noise when I operate it.

        "page_content": "Claude is hallucinatingSuggest EditsThough this is not fully solved yet, there are ways to minimize hallucinations. \nAsk Claude multiple times\nOne feature of hallucinations is that they tend to be different across different outputs. So if you\u2019re worried about Claude generating hallucinations, you can create multiple outputs and ask the model if the two outputs are consistent.\nFor example, suppose you want the model to extract dollar amounts from a document and to produce a summary like \u201cThe cost of the house is $500k and it\u2019s located in the state of Texas\u201d. If you generate two outputs and the dollar amount and state are the same, it\u2019s less likely to be a hallucination.\nIf there are inconsistent facts in the two outputs, it\u2019s likely that one of them contains a hallucination. You can ask the model if the two responses contain any inconsistencies and use this as a way to flag potential hallucinations.\nYou should check the accuracy of this technique using your own examples, since its success (and efficiency relative to alternatives) will vary by task type.\nGive Claude a \"way out\" if it doesn't know the answer\nTry explicitly giving Claude permission to say \"I don't know\", especially when asking it fact-based (rather than analytical) questions.\nSee Let Claude say \"I don't know\" for more details.\n\ud83d\udca1ReminderWhile Claude has read a lot on the internet and knows things about the real world, it does not have internet access. Claude was trained on data that can be two years out of date. It also does not know today's date, nor anything about current events.\nAsk Claude for direct quotes\n\ud83d\udea7WarningThis applies to extracting information from documents you provide in the prompt. This is better for longer documents and worse for short ones (<300 words). Claude is more likely to hallucinate fake quotes if documents are short.\nModels seem less likely to hallucinate direct quotes from long documents than to hallucinate content of documents if asked a question about them.\nIf you have a document with various statistics about cats and you say What is the average weight of a Russian Blue?, the model is more likely to hallucinate an answer than if you say Please extract word-for-word quotes from this document that are relevant to the question \u2018What is the average weight of a Russian Blue?\nThis is especially true if you can have a few shot prompt that contains examples where there are no relevant quotes to which the model responds \u201cI can\u2019t find any quotes relevant to that\u201d. But this might not be possible if you\u2019re extracting quotes from very long documents (since it\u2019s costly to have very long few-shot prompts in this case). \nAdditionally, direct quotes are easier to verify the accuracy of than other answers. If you have a document and you request word-for-word quotes, you can do a string match on the model quotes to check that they appear in the document and check for percentage of overlap.\n\ud83d\udca1NoteYou might not get 100% overlap but want it to be high, e.g. the model might add \"[sic.]\" if there is an error in the document or might add context to the quotes like he [Brian] asked her [Diana] to dinner which is fine as long as the added content is accurate. If you think it\u2019s adding inaccurate content then you may want to just filter for a very high degree of overlap and make the instructions more rigorous, e.g. by adding something like Please ensure your quotes are directly from the document, and do not add any additional content like disambiguations or comments.\nSome examples of ways to do overlap checks in Python:\nPython# edit distance\nimport nltk\nsurplus = max(0, len(doc) - len(quote))\nedit_distance = nltk.edit_distance(quote, doc) - surplus\n\n# block matching\nfrom difflib import SequenceMatcher\nmax([b[-1] for b in SequenceMatcher(None, doc, quote).get_matching_blocks()]) / len(quote)\n\nWhat you want is quotes that appear in the document and are relevant to the question. If the model is good at identifying relevant quotes for your use case (which it often is but you should check), this ensures that it\u2019s not hallucinating the quotes.\nExample: zero-shot prompt to generate direct quotes\nPrompt for Relevant Quotes\n\nHuman: Consider the following document:\n\n{{DOCUMENT}}\n\nPlease identify the quotes in this article most relevant to the question \"{{QUESTION}}\" and copy them out word-for-word. If there are no quotes in this document that seem relevant to this question, please just say \"I can\u2019t find any relevant quotes\".\n\nAssistant:\n\nDocument summary\nDocument summary or text + direct quotes often make answers more accurate. Sometimes the model might need the full text plus the direct quotes to give an answer, but sometimes a summary plus the direct quotes will be enough.\nFor example, one can ask for:\n\nA summary of the article:\n\nPrompt for Article Summary\n\nHuman: Consider the following article:\n\n{{DOCUMENT}}\n\nPlease write a one paragraph, high level summary of this article.\n\nAssistant: Here is a summary of the document:\n\n\n\nSeparately, direct quotes from the article relevant to the question (see previous section)\n\n\nThen request an answer based on these:\n\n\nCombined Prompt\n\nHuman: I want you to use a summary of a document and quotes from the document to answer the question \u201c{{QUESTION}}\u201d\n\nHere is a summary of the document: {{SUMMARY}}\n\nHere are direct quotes from the document that are most relevant to the question \"{{QUESTION}}\": {{QUOTES}} \n\nPlease use these to construct an answer to the question \"{{QUESTION}}\" as though you were answering the question directly. Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn\u2019t contain any information not directly supported by the summary and quotes.\n\nAssistant:\n\nThis can be more accurate than extracting quotes alone.Updated about 2 months ago Table of Contents\n\nAsk Claude multiple times\n\n\nGive Claude a \"way out\" if it doesn't know the answer\n\n\nAsk Claude for direct quotes\n\nExample: zero-shot prompt to generate direct quotes\nDocument summary\n\n\n",
