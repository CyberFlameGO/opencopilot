How to use?\u200bpip install yeagerai-agentyeagerai-agentGo to http://127.0.0.1:7860This will install the necessary dependencies and set up yAgents on your system. After the first run, yAgents will create a .env file where you can input your OpenAI API key. You can do the same directly from the Gradio interface under the tab \"Settings\".OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key_here>We recommend using GPT-4,. However, the tool can also work with GPT-3 if the problem is broken down sufficiently.Creating and Executing Tools with yAgents\u200byAgents makes it easy to create and execute AI-powered tools. Here's a brief overview of the process:Create a tool: To create a tool, provide a natural language prompt to yAgents. The prompt should clearly describe the tool's purpose and functionality. For example:\ncreate a tool that returns the n-th prime numberLoad the tool into the toolkit: To load a tool into yAgents, simply provide a command to yAgents that says so. For example:\nload the tool that you just created it into your toolkitExecute the tool: To run a tool or agent, simply provide a command to yAgents that includes the name of the tool and any required parameters. For example:\ngenerate the 50th prime numberYou can see a video of how it works here.As you become more familiar with yAgents, you can create more advanced tools and agents to automate your work and enhance your productivity.For more information, see yAgents' Github or our docs",

A callback handler, also known as a callback function or callback method, is a piece of code that is executed in response to a specific event or condition. It is commonly used in programming languages that support event-driven or asynchronous programming paradigms.        The purpose of a callback handler is to provide a way for developers to define custom behavior that should be executed when a certain event occurs. Instead of waiting for a result or blocking the execution, the program registers a callback function and continues with other tasks. When the event is triggered, the callback function is invoked, allowing the program to respond accordingly.        Callback handlers are commonly used in various scenarios, such as handling user input, responding to network requests, processing asynchronous operations, and implementing event-driven architectures. They provide a flexible and modular way to handle events and decouple different components of a system.    >>> input >>>    >>>: What do I need to do to get the full benefits of this    To get the full benefits of using a callback handler, you should consider the following:        1. Understand the event or condition: Identify the specific event or condition that you want to respond to with a callback handler. This could be user input, network requests, or any other asynchronous operation.        2. Define the callback function: Create a function that will be executed when the event or condition occurs. This function should contain the desired behavior or actions you want to take in response to the event.        3. Register the callback function: Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, you may need to register or attach the callback function to the appropriate event or condition. This ensures that the callback function is invoked when the event occurs.        4. Handle the callback: Implement the necessary logic within the callback function to handle the event or condition. This could involve updating the user interface, processing data, making further requests, or triggering other actions.        5. Consider error handling: It's important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur within the callback function. This ensures that your program can gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes or undesired behavior.        6. Maintain code readability and modularity: As your codebase grows, it's crucial to keep your callback handlers organized and maintainable. Consider using design patterns or architectural principles to structure your code in a modular and scalable way.        By following these steps, you can leverage the benefits of callback handlers, such as asynchronous and event-driven programming, improved responsiveness, and modular code design.    >>> input >>>    >>>: q",

This is especially helpful when users are expected to query the knowledge base in different languages, or when state of the art embeddings models are not available for a given language.We can accomplish this using the Doctran library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to translate documents between languages.pip install doctranfrom langchain.schema import Documentfrom langchain.document_transformers import DoctranTextTranslatorfrom dotenv import load_dotenvload_dotenv()    TrueInput\u200bThis is the document we'll translatesample_text = \"\"\"[Generated with ChatGPT]Confidential Document - For Internal Use OnlyDate: July 1, 2023Subject: Updates and Discussions on Various TopicsDear Team,I hope this email finds you well.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible.

Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\'t prove popular.

You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming.

Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous.

How do you deploy it and make it easily shareable with the world?This section covers several options for that. Note that these options are meant for quick deployment of prototypes and demos, not for production systems. If you need help with the deployment of a production system, please contact us directly.What follows is a list of template GitHub repositories designed to be easily forked and modified to use your chain. This list is far from exhaustive, and we are EXTREMELY open to contributions here.Streamlit\u200bThis repo serves as a template for how to deploy a LangChain with Streamlit.\nIt implements a chatbot interface.\nIt also contains instructions for how to deploy this app on the Streamlit platform.Gradio (on Hugging Face)\u200bThis repo serves as a template for how deploy a LangChain with Gradio.\nIt implements a chatbot interface, with a \"Bring-Your-Own-Token\" approach (nice for not wracking up big bills).\nIt also contains instructions for how to deploy this app on the Hugging Face platform.\nThis is heavily influenced by James Weaver's excellent examples.Chainlit\u200bThis repo is a cookbook explaining how to visualize and deploy LangChain agents with Chainlit.\nYou create ChatGPT-like UIs with Chainlit. Some of the key features include intermediary steps visualisation, element management & display (images, text, carousel, etc.) as well as cloud deployment.\nChainlit doc on the integration with LangChainBeam\u200bThis repo serves as a template for how deploy a LangChain with Beam.It implements a Question Answering app and contains instructions for deploying the app as a serverless REST API.Vercel\u200bA minimal example on how to run LangChain on Vercel using Flask.FastAPI + Vercel\u200bA minimal example on how to run LangChain on Vercel using FastAPI and LangCorn/Uvicorn.Kinsta\u200bA minimal example on how to deploy LangChain to Kinsta using Flask.Fly.io\u200bA minimal example of how to deploy LangChain to Fly.io using Flask.Digitalocean App Platform\u200bA minimal example on how to deploy LangChain to DigitalOcean App Platform.CI/CD Google Cloud Build + Dockerfile + Serverless Google Cloud Run\u200bBoilerplate LangChain project on how to deploy to Google Cloud Run using Docker with Cloud Build CI/CD pipelineGoogle Cloud Run\u200bA minimal example on how to deploy LangChain to Google Cloud Run.SteamShip\u200bThis repository contains LangChain adapters for Steamship, enabling LangChain developers to rapidly deploy their apps on Steamship. This includes: production-ready endpoints, horizontal scaling across dependencies, persistent storage of app state, multi-tenancy support, etc.Langchain-serve\u200bThis repository allows users to deploy any LangChain app as REST/WebSocket APIs or, as Slack Bots with ease. Benefit from the scalability and serverless architecture of Jina AI Cloud, or deploy on-premise with Kubernetes.BentoML\u200bThis repository provides an example of how to deploy a LangChain application with BentoML. BentoML is a framework that enables the containerization of machine learning applications as standard OCI images. BentoML also allows for the automatic generation of OpenAPI and gRPC endpoints. With BentoML, you can integrate models from all popular ML frameworks and deploy them as microservices running on the most optimal hardware and scaling independently.OpenLLM\u200bOpenLLM is a platform for operating large language models (LLMs) in production. With OpenLLM, you can run inference with any open-source LLM, deploy to the cloud or on-premises, and build powerful AI apps. It supports a wide range of open-source LLMs, offers flexible APIs, and first-class support for LangChain and BentoML.\nSee OpenLLM's integration doc for usage with LangChain.Databutton\u200bThese templates serve as examples of how to build, deploy, and share LangChain applications using Databutton. You can create user interfaces with Streamlit, automate tasks by scheduling Python code, and store files and data in the built-in store. Examples include a Chatbot interface with conversational memory, a Personal search engine, and a starter template for LangChain apps. Deploying and sharing is just one click away.",

This is useful if we want to generate text that is able to draw from a large body of custom text, for example, generating blog posts that have an understanding of previous blog posts written, or product tutorials that can refer to product documentation.Prepare Data\u200bFirst, we prepare the data. For this example, we fetch a documentation site that consists of markdown files hosted on Github and split them into small enough Documents.from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.docstore.document import Documentimport requestsfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplateimport pathlibimport subprocessimport tempfiledef get_github_docs(repo_owner, repo_name):    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:        subprocess.check_call(            f\"git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}.git .\",            cwd=d,            shell=True,        )        git_sha = (            subprocess.check_output(\"git rev-parse HEAD\", shell=True, cwd=d)            .decode(\"utf-8\")            .strip()        )        repo_path = pathlib.Path(d)        markdown_files = list(repo_path.glob(\"*/*.md\")) + list(            repo_path.glob(\"*/*.mdx\")        )        for markdown_file in markdown_files:            with open(markdown_file, \"r\") as f:                relative_path = markdown_file.relative_to(repo_path)                github_url = f\"https://github.com/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}/blob/{git_sha}/{relative_path}\"                yield Document(page_content=f.read(), metadata={\"source\": github_url})sources = get_github_docs(\"yirenlu92\", \"deno-manual-forked\")source_chunks = []splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(separator=\" \", chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=0)for source in sources:    for chunk in splitter.split_text(source.page_content):        source_chunks.append(Document(page_content=chunk, metadata=source.metadata))    Cloning into '.'...Set Up Vector DB\u200bNow that we have the documentation content in chunks, let's put all this information in a vector index for easy retrieval.search_index = Chroma.from_documents(source_chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings())Set Up LLM Chain with Custom Prompt\u200bNext, let's set up a simple LLM chain but give it a custom prompt for blog post generation. Note that the custom prompt is parameterized and takes two inputs: context, which will be the documents fetched from the vector search, and topic, which is given by the user.from langchain.chains import LLMChainprompt_template = \"\"\"Use the context below to write a 400 word blog post about the topic below:    Context: {context}    Topic: {topic}    Blog post:\"\"\"PROMPT = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[\"context\", \"topic\"])llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PROMPT)Generate Text\u200bFinally, we write a function to apply our inputs to the chain. The function takes an input parameter topic. We find the documents in the vector index that correspond to that topic, and use them as additional context in our simple LLM chain.def generate_blog_post(topic):    docs = search_index.similarity_search(topic, k=4)    inputs = [{\"context\": doc.page_content, \"topic\": topic} for doc in docs]    print(chain.apply(inputs))generate_blog_post(\"environment variables\")    [{'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a great way to store and access sensitive information in your Deno applications. Deno offers built-in support for environment variables with `Deno.env`, and you can also use a `.env` file to store and access environment variables.\\n\\nUsing `Deno.env` is simple. It has getter and setter methods, so you can easily set and retrieve environment variables. For example, you can set the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` environment variables like this:\\n\\n```ts\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\", \"examplekey123\");\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\", \"firebasedomain.com\");\\n\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\")); // examplekey123\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\")); // firebasedomain.com\\n```\\n\\nYou can also store environment variables in a `.env` file. This is a great'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for managing configuration settings in a program. They allow us to set values that can be used by the program, without having to hard-code them into the code. This makes it easier to change settings without having to modify the code.\\n\\nIn Deno, environment variables can be set in a few different ways. The most common way is to use the `VAR=value` syntax. This will set the environment variable `VAR` to the value `value`. This can be used to set any number of environment variables before running a command. For example, if we wanted to set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running a Deno command, we could do so like this:\\n\\n```\\nVAR=hello deno run main.ts\\n```\\n\\nThis will set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running the command. We can then access this variable in our code using the `Deno.env.get()` function. For example, if we ran the following command:\\n\\n```\\nVAR=hello && deno eval \"console.log(\\'Deno: \\' + Deno.env.get(\\'VAR'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to store and access data without having to hard-code it into their applications. In Deno, you can access environment variables using the `Deno.env.get()` function.\\n\\nFor example, if you wanted to access the `HOME` environment variable, you could do so like this:\\n\\n```js\\n// env.js\\nDeno.env.get(\"HOME\");\\n```\\n\\nWhen running this code, you\\'ll need to grant the Deno process access to environment variables. This can be done by passing the `--allow-env` flag to the `deno run` command. You can also specify which environment variables you want to grant access to, like this:\\n\\n```shell\\n# Allow access to only the HOME env var\\ndeno run --allow-env=HOME env.js\\n```\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that environment variables are case insensitive on Windows, so Deno also matches them case insensitively (on Windows only).\\n\\nAnother thing to be aware of when using environment variables is subprocess permissions. Subprocesses are powerful and can access system resources regardless of the permissions you granted to the Den'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are an important part of any programming language, and Deno is no exception. Deno is a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine, and it recently added support for environment variables. This feature was added in Deno version 1.6.0, and it is now available for use in Deno applications.\\n\\nEnvironment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs. They are typically used to store configuration information, such as the location of a database or the name of a user. In Deno, environment variables are stored in the `Deno.env` object. This object is similar to the `process.env` object in Node.js, and it allows you to access and set environment variables.\\n\\nThe `Deno.env` object is a read-only object, meaning that you cannot directly modify the environment variables. Instead, you must use the `Deno.env.set()` function to set environment variables. This function takes two arguments: the name of the environment variable and the value to set it to. For example, if you wanted to set the `FOO` environment variable to `bar`, you would use the following code:\\n\\n```'}]",

With Rockset, ingested data is queryable within one second and analytical queries against that data typically execute in milliseconds. Rockset is compute optimized, making it suitable for serving high concurrency applications in the sub-100TB range (or larger than 100s of TBs with rollups).This notebook demonstrates how to use Rockset as a document loader in langchain. To get started, make sure you have a Rockset account and an API key available.Setting up the environment\u200bGo to the Rockset console and get an API key. Find your API region from the API reference.

Prompt templates can take any number of input variables, and can be formatted to generate a prompt.from langchain import PromptTemplate# An example prompt with no input variablesno_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template=\"Tell me a joke.\")no_input_prompt.format()# -> \"Tell me a joke.\"# An example prompt with one input variableone_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"adjective\"], template=\"Tell me a {adjective} joke.\")one_input_prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\")# -> \"Tell me a funny joke.\"# An example prompt with multiple input variablesmultiple_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[\"adjective\", \"content\"],     template=\"Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.\")multiple_input_prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\")# -> \"Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\"If you do not wish to specify input_variables manually, you can also create a PromptTemplate using from_template class method. langchain will automatically infer the input_variables based on the template passed.template = \"Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.\"prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)prompt_template.input_variables# -> ['adjective', 'content']prompt_template.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\")# -> Tell me a funny joke about chickens.You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see Custom Prompt Templates.Chat prompt template\u200bChat Models take a list of chat messages as input - this list commonly referred to as a prompt.\nThese chat messages differ from raw string (which you would pass into a LLM model) in that every message is associated with a role.For example, in OpenAI Chat Completion API, a chat message can be associated with the AI, human or system role. The model is supposed to follow instruction from system chat message more closely.LangChain provides several prompt templates to make constructing and working with prompts easily. You are encouraged to use these chat related prompt templates instead of PromptTemplate when querying chat models to fully exploit the potential of underlying chat model.from langchain.prompts import (    ChatPromptTemplate,    PromptTemplate,    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,    AIMessagePromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)from langchain.schema import (    AIMessage,    HumanMessage,    SystemMessage)To create a message template associated with a role, you use MessagePromptTemplate.For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like:template=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\"system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)human_template=\"{text}\"human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)If you wanted to construct the MessagePromptTemplate more directly, you could create a PromptTemplate outside and then pass it in, eg:prompt=PromptTemplate(    template=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\",    input_variables=[\"input_language\", \"output_language\"],)system_message_prompt_2 = SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=prompt)assert system_message_prompt == system_message_prompt_2After that, you can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate's format_prompt -- this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])# get a chat completion from the formatted messageschat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\").to_messages()    [SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}),     HumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})]",

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\nGetting Started\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nUse Cases\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nReference Docs\\nAll of LangChain\u2019s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\nReference Documentation\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we\u2019d love to offer more comprehensive support.

It is more general than a vector store.\nA retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used\nas the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.Get started\u200bThe public API of the BaseRetriever class in LangChain is as follows:from abc import ABC, abstractmethodfrom typing import Any, Listfrom langchain.schema import Documentfrom langchain.callbacks.manager import Callbacksclass BaseRetriever(ABC):    ...    def get_relevant_documents(        self, query: str, *, callbacks: Callbacks = None, **kwargs: Any    ) -> List[Document]:        \"\"\"Retrieve documents relevant to a query.        Args:            query: string to find relevant documents for            callbacks: Callback manager or list of callbacks        Returns:            List of relevant documents        \"\"\"        ...    async def aget_relevant_documents(        self, query: str, *, callbacks: Callbacks = None, **kwargs: Any    ) -> List[Document]:        \"\"\"Asynchronously get documents relevant to a query.        Args:            query: string to find relevant documents for            callbacks: Callback manager or list of callbacks        Returns:            List of relevant documents        \"\"\"        ...It's that simple! You can call get_relevant_documents or the async get_relevant_documents methods to retrieve documents relevant to a query, where \"relevance\" is defined by\nthe specific retriever object you are calling.Of course, we also help construct what we think useful Retrievers are. The main type of Retriever that we focus on is a Vectorstore retriever. We will focus on that for the rest of this guide.In order to understand what a vectorstore retriever is, it's important to understand what a Vectorstore is. So let's look at that.By default, LangChain uses Chroma as the vectorstore to index and search embeddings. To walk through this tutorial, we'll first need to install chromadb.pip install chromadbThis example showcases question answering over documents.\nWe have chosen this as the example for getting started because it nicely combines a lot of different elements (Text splitters, embeddings, vectorstores) and then also shows how to use them in a chain.Question answering over documents consists of four steps:Create an indexCreate a Retriever from that indexCreate a question answering chainAsk questions!Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations. In this notebook we will primarily focus on (1). We will start by showing the one-liner for doing so, but then break down what is actually going on.First, let's import some common classes we'll use no matter what.from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAfrom langchain.llms import OpenAINext in the generic setup, let's specify the document loader we want to use. You can download the state_of_the_union.txt file herefrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderloader = TextLoader('../state_of_the_union.txt', encoding='utf8')One Line Index Creation\u200bTo get started as quickly as possible, we can use the VectorstoreIndexCreator.from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreatorindex = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])    Running Chroma using direct local API.    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.Now that the index is created, we can use it to ask questions of the data! Note that under the hood this is actually doing a few steps as well, which we will cover later in this guide.query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"index.query(query)    \" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\"query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"index.query_with_sources(query)    {'question': 'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson',     'answer': \" The president said that he nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of the nation's top legal minds, to continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence, and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\\n\",     'sources': '../state_of_the_union.txt'}What is returned from the VectorstoreIndexCreator is VectorStoreIndexWrapper, which provides these nice query and query_with_sources functionality. If we just wanted to access the vectorstore directly, we can also do that.index.vectorstore    <langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma at 0x119aa5940>If we then want to access the VectorstoreRetriever, we can do that with:index.vectorstore.as_retriever()    VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma object at 0x119aa5940>, search_kwargs={})Walkthrough\u200bOkay, so what's actually going on? How is this index getting created?A lot of the magic is being hid in this VectorstoreIndexCreator. What is this doing?There are three main steps going on after the documents are loaded:Splitting documents into chunksCreating embeddings for each documentStoring documents and embeddings in a vectorstoreLet's walk through this in codedocuments = loader.load()Next, we will split the documents into chunks.from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplittertext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)We will then select which embeddings we want to use.from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()We now create the vectorstore to use as the index.from langchain.vectorstores import Chromadb = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)    Running Chroma using direct local API.    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.So that's creating the index. Then, we expose this index in a retriever interface.retriever = db.as_retriever()Then, as before, we create a chain and use it to answer questions!qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=retriever)query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"qa.run(query)    \" The President said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He said she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\"VectorstoreIndexCreator is just a wrapper around all this logic. It is configurable in the text splitter it uses, the embeddings it uses, and the vectorstore it uses. For example, you can configure it as below:index_creator = VectorstoreIndexCreator(    vectorstore_cls=Chroma,    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),    text_splitter=CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0))Hopefully this highlights what is going on under the hood of VectorstoreIndexCreator. While we think it's important to have a simple way to create indexes, we also think it's important to understand what's going on under the hood.",

It is a lightweight wrapper around the Vector Store class to make it conform to the Retriever interface.\nIt uses the search methods implemented by a vector store, like similarity search and MMR, to query the texts in the vector store.Once you construct a Vector store, it's very easy to construct a retriever.

It is a key type of structural unemployment.    Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing's Bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.    That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs. Whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle's time.    Prior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.    The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.    In the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment. While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again. A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\". Recent technological innovations have the potential to displace humans in the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\". The World Bank's World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.        Page: Artificial intelligence    Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence\u2014perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information\u2014demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals or by humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.    AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.    The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.

Officer Mora was 27 years old.         Officer Rivera was 22.         Both Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.         I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.         I\u2019ve worked on these issues a long time.         I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who\u2019ll walk the beat, who\u2019ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.         So let\u2019s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.         Let\u2019s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.         That\u2019s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.         That\u2019s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption\u2014trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.          We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.         I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.          And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home\u2014they have no serial numbers and can\u2019t be traced.         And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?         Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.         Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\u2019t be sued.         These laws don\u2019t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.         The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote \u2013 and to have it counted. And it\u2019s under assault.         In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.         We cannot let this happen.         Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.         Tonight, I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.         One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.         And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.         A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support\u2014from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.         And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.         We can do both. At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.          We\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.          We\u2019re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.",

It is an all-in-one workspace for notetaking, knowledge and data management, and project and task management.NotionDBLoader is a Python class for loading content from a Notion database. It retrieves pages from the database, reads their content, and returns a list of Document objects.Requirements\u200bA Notion DatabaseNotion Integration TokenSetup\u200b1. Create a Notion Table Database\u200bCreate a new table database in Notion. You can add any column to the database and they will be treated as metadata. For example you can add the following columns:Title: set Title as the default property.Categories: A Multi-select property to store categories associated with the page.Keywords: A Multi-select property to store keywords associated with the page.Add your content to the body of each page in the database. The NotionDBLoader will extract the content and metadata from these pages.2. Create a Notion Integration\u200bTo create a Notion Integration, follow these steps:Visit the Notion Developers page and log in with your Notion account.Click on the \"+ New integration\" button.Give your integration a name and choose the workspace where your database is located.Select the require capabilities, this extension only need the Read content capabilityClick the \"Submit\" button to create the integration.\nOnce the integration is created, you'll be provided with an Integration Token (API key). Copy this token and keep it safe, as you'll need it to use the NotionDBLoader.3. Connect the Integration to the Database\u200bTo connect your integration to the database, follow these steps:Open your database in Notion.Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the database view.Click on the \"+ New integration\" button.Find your integration, you may need to start typing its name in the search box.Click on the \"Connect\" button to connect the integration to the database.4. Get the Database ID\u200bTo get the database ID, follow these steps:Open your database in Notion.Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the database view.Select \"Copy link\" from the menu to copy the database URL to your clipboard.The database ID is the long string of alphanumeric characters found in the URL. It typically looks like this: https://www.notion.so/username/8935f9d140a04f95a872520c4f123456?v=.... In this example, the database ID is 8935f9d140a04f95a872520c4f123456.With the database properly set up and the integration token and database ID in hand, you can now use the NotionDBLoader code to load content and metadata from your Notion database.Usage\u200bNotionDBLoader is part of the langchain package's document loaders.

In order to do so, it is necessary to specify the runtime parameter as {'tensor_db': True} during the creation of the vector store. This configuration enables the execution of queries on the Managed Tensor Database, rather than on the client side. It should be noted that this functionality is not applicable to datasets stored locally or in-memory. In the event that a vector store has already been created outside of the Managed Tensor Database, it is possible to transfer it to the Managed Tensor Database by following the prescribed steps.# from langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake# db = DeepLake.from_documents(#     texts, embeddings, dataset_path=f\"hub://{<org_id>}/langchain-code\", runtime={\"tensor_db\": True}# )# dbQuestion Answering\u200bFirst load the dataset, construct the retriever, then construct the Conversational Chaindb = DeepLake(    dataset_path=f\"hub://{<org_id>}/langchain-code\",    read_only=True,    embedding_function=embeddings,)retriever = db.as_retriever()retriever.search_kwargs[\"distance_metric\"] = \"cos\"retriever.search_kwargs[\"fetch_k\"] = 20retriever.search_kwargs[\"maximal_marginal_relevance\"] = Trueretriever.search_kwargs[\"k\"] = 20You can also specify user defined functions using Deep Lake filtersdef filter(x):    # filter based on source code    if \"something\" in x[\"text\"].data()[\"value\"]:        return False    # filter based on path e.g. extension    metadata = x[\"metadata\"].data()[\"value\"]    return \"only_this\" in metadata[\"source\"] or \"also_that\" in metadata[\"source\"]### turn on below for custom filtering# retriever.search_kwargs['filter'] = filterfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChainmodel = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")  # 'ada' 'gpt-3.5-turbo' 'gpt-4',qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(model, retriever=retriever)questions = [    \"What is the class hierarchy?\",    # \"What classes are derived from the Chain class?\",    # \"What classes and functions in the ./langchain/utilities/ forlder are not covered by unit tests?\",    # \"What one improvement do you propose in code in relation to the class herarchy for the Chain class?\",]chat_history = []for question in questions:    result = qa({\"question\": question, \"chat_history\": chat_history})    chat_history.append((question, result[\"answer\"]))    print(f\"-> **Question**: {question} \\n\")    print(f\"**Answer**: {result['answer']} \\n\")-> Question: What is the class hierarchy?

This is useful because (1) plugins use OpenAPI endpoints under the hood, (2) wrapping them in an NLAChain allows the router agent to call it more easily.The novel idea introduced in this notebook is the idea of using retrieval to select not the tools explicitly, but the set of OpenAPI specs to use. We can then generate tools from those OpenAPI specs. The use case for this is when trying to get agents to use plugins. It may be more efficient to choose plugins first, then the endpoints, rather than the endpoints directly.

        "page_content": "Question AnsweringThis notebook covers how to evaluate generic question answering problems. This is a situation where you have an example containing a question and its corresponding ground truth answer, and you want to measure how well the language model does at answering those questions.Setup\u200bFor demonstration purposes, we will just evaluate a simple question answering system that only evaluates the model's internal knowledge. Please see other notebooks for examples where it evaluates how the model does at question answering over data not present in what the model was trained on.from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain.chains import LLMChainfrom langchain.llms import OpenAIprompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Question: {question}\\nAnswer:\", input_variables=[\"question\"])llm = OpenAI(model_name=\"text-davinci-003\", temperature=0)chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)Examples\u200bFor this purpose, we will just use two simple hardcoded examples, but see other notebooks for tips on how to get and/or generate these examples.examples = [    {        \"question\": \"Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?\",        \"answer\": \"11\",    },    {        \"question\": 'Is the following sentence plausible? \"Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship.\"',        \"answer\": \"No\",    },]Predictions\u200bWe can now make and inspect the predictions for these questions.predictions = chain.apply(examples)predictions    [{'text': ' 11 tennis balls'},     {'text': ' No, this sentence is not plausible. Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player, not an American football player, so it is not likely that he would be catching a screen pass in the NFC championship.'}]Evaluation\u200bWe can see that if we tried to just do exact match on the answer answers (11 and No) they would not match what the language model answered. However, semantically the language model is correct in both cases. In order to account for this, we can use a language model itself to evaluate the answers.from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChainllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(    examples, predictions, question_key=\"question\", prediction_key=\"text\")for i, eg in enumerate(examples):    print(f\"Example {i}:\")    print(\"Question: \" + eg[\"question\"])    print(\"Real Answer: \" + eg[\"answer\"])    print(\"Predicted Answer: \" + predictions[i][\"text\"])    print(\"Predicted Grade: \" + graded_outputs[i][\"text\"])    print()    Example 0:    Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?    Real Answer: 11    Predicted Answer:  11 tennis balls    Predicted Grade:  CORRECT        Example 1:    Question: Is the following sentence plausible? \"Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship.\"    Real Answer: No    Predicted Answer:  No, this sentence is not plausible. Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player, not an American football player, so it is not likely that he would be catching a screen pass in the NFC championship.    Predicted Grade:  CORRECT    Customize Prompt\u200bYou can also customize the prompt that is used. Here is an example prompting it using a score from 0 to 10.\nThe custom prompt requires 3 input variables: \"query\", \"answer\" and \"result\". Where \"query\" is the question, \"answer\" is the ground truth answer, and \"result\" is the predicted answer.from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"You are an expert professor specialized in grading students' answers to questions.You are grading the following question:{query}Here is the real answer:{answer}You are grading the following predicted answer:{result}What grade do you give from 0 to 10, where 0 is the lowest (very low similarity) and 10 is the highest (very high similarity)?\"\"\"PROMPT = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[\"query\", \"answer\", \"result\"], template=_PROMPT_TEMPLATE)evalchain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm=llm, prompt=PROMPT)evalchain.evaluate(    examples,    predictions,    question_key=\"question\",    answer_key=\"answer\",    prediction_key=\"text\",)Evaluation without Ground Truth\u200bIts possible to evaluate question answering systems without ground truth. You would need a \"context\" input that reflects what the information the LLM uses to answer the question. This context can be obtained by any retreival system. Here's an example of how it works:context_examples = [    {        \"question\": \"How old am I?\",        \"context\": \"I am 30 years old. I live in New York and take the train to work everyday.\",    },    {        \"question\": 'Who won the NFC championship game in 2023?\"',        \"context\": \"NFC Championship Game 2023: Philadelphia Eagles 31, San Francisco 49ers 7\",    },]QA_PROMPT = \"Answer the question based on the  context\\nContext:{context}\\nQuestion:{question}\\nAnswer:\"template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"context\", \"question\"], template=QA_PROMPT)qa_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=template)predictions = qa_chain.apply(context_examples)predictions    [{'text': 'You are 30 years old.'},     {'text': ' The Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC championship game in 2023.'}]from langchain.evaluation.qa import ContextQAEvalChaineval_chain = ContextQAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(    context_examples, predictions, question_key=\"question\", prediction_key=\"text\")graded_outputs    [{'text': ' CORRECT'}, {'text': ' CORRECT'}]Comparing to other evaluation metrics\u200bWe can compare the evaluation results we get to other common evaluation metrics. To do this, let's load some evaluation metrics from HuggingFace's evaluate package.# Some data munging to get the examples in the right formatfor i, eg in enumerate(examples):    eg[\"id\"] = str(i)    eg[\"answers\"] = {\"text\": [eg[\"answer\"]], \"answer_start\": [0]}    predictions[i][\"id\"] = str(i)    predictions[i][\"prediction_text\"] = predictions[i][\"text\"]for p in predictions:    del p[\"text\"]new_examples = examples.copy()for eg in new_examples:    del eg[\"question\"]    del eg[\"answer\"]from evaluate import loadsquad_metric = load(\"squad\")results = squad_metric.compute(    references=new_examples,    predictions=predictions,)results    {'exact_match': 0.0, 'f1': 28.125}",

At a high level, HyDE is an embedding technique that takes queries, generates a hypothetical answer, and then embeds that generated document and uses that as the final example. In order to use HyDE, we therefore need to provide a base embedding model, as well as an LLMChain that can be used to generate those documents. By default, the HyDE class comes with some default prompts to use (see the paper for more details on them), but we can also create our own.from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain, HypotheticalDocumentEmbedderfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplatebase_embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()llm = OpenAI()# Load with `web_search` promptembeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(llm, base_embeddings, \"web_search\")# Now we can use it as any embedding class!result = embeddings.embed_query(\"Where is the Taj Mahal?\")Multiple generations\u200bWe can also generate multiple documents and then combine the embeddings for those. By default, we combine those by taking the average. We can do this by changing the LLM we use to generate documents to return multiple things.multi_llm = OpenAI(n=4, best_of=4)embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(    multi_llm, base_embeddings, \"web_search\")result = embeddings.embed_query(\"Where is the Taj Mahal?\")Using our own prompts\u200bBesides using preconfigured prompts, we can also easily construct our own prompts and use those in the LLMChain that is generating the documents. This can be useful if we know the domain our queries will be in, as we can condition the prompt to generate text more similar to that.In the example below, let's condition it to generate text about a state of the union address (because we will use that in the next example).prompt_template = \"\"\"Please answer the user's question about the most recent state of the union addressQuestion: {question}Answer:\"\"\"prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"question\"], template=prompt_template)llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder(    llm_chain=llm_chain, base_embeddings=base_embeddings)result = embeddings.embed_query(    \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\")Using HyDE\u200bNow that we have HyDE, we can use it as we would any other embedding class!

However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their \"cognitive\" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond.The original implementation: https://github.com/lightaime/camelProject website: https://www.camel-ai.org/Arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760Import LangChain related modules\u200bfrom typing import Listfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)from langchain.schema import (    AIMessage,    HumanMessage,    SystemMessage,    BaseMessage,)Define a CAMEL agent helper class\u200bclass CAMELAgent:    def __init__(        self,        system_message: SystemMessage,        model: ChatOpenAI,    ) -> None:        self.system_message = system_message        self.model = model        self.init_messages()    def reset(self) -> None:        self.init_messages()        return self.stored_messages    def init_messages(self) -> None:        self.stored_messages = [self.system_message]    def update_messages(self, message: BaseMessage) -> List[BaseMessage]:        self.stored_messages.append(message)        return self.stored_messages    def step(        self,        input_message: HumanMessage,    ) -> AIMessage:        messages = self.update_messages(input_message)        output_message = self.model(messages)        self.update_messages(output_message)        return output_messageSetup OpenAI API key and roles and task for role-playing\u200bimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"assistant_role_name = \"Python Programmer\"user_role_name = \"Stock Trader\"task = \"Develop a trading bot for the stock market\"word_limit = 50  # word limit for task brainstormingCreate a task specify agent for brainstorming and get the specified task\u200btask_specifier_sys_msg = SystemMessage(content=\"You can make a task more specific.\")task_specifier_prompt = \"\"\"Here is a task that {assistant_role_name} will help {user_role_name} to complete: {task}.Please make it more specific.

AI Assistant (Python Programmer):        Solution: We can create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. We need to pass the stop loss and profit target as percentages as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new column:        ```    stop_loss = stop_loss_percent / 100    profit_target = profit_target_percent / 100        new_df['pnl'] = 0.0    buy_price = 0.0    for i in range(1, len(new_df)):        if new_df['signal'][i] == 1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == -1:            buy_price = new_df['close'][i]        elif new_df['signal'][i] == -1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == 1:            sell_price = new_df['close'][i]            if sell_price <= buy_price * (1 - stop_loss):                new_df['pnl'][i] = -stop_loss            elif sell_price >= buy_price * (1 + profit_target):                new_df['pnl'][i] = profit_target            else:                new_df['pnl'][i] = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price    ```        This will create a new column called 'pnl' in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. The stop loss and profit target are calculated based on the stop_loss_percent and profit_target_percent variables, respectively. The buy and sell prices are stored in the buy_price and sell_price variables, respectively. If the sell price is less than or equal to the stop loss, the profit or loss is set to -stop_loss. If the sell price is greater than or equal to the profit target, the profit or loss is set to profit_target. Otherwise, the profit or loss is calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price. Next request.            AI User (Stock Trader):        Instruction: Calculate the total profit or loss for all trades.    Input: None.

If we convert documents into Q&A format before vectorizing them, we can increase the liklihood of retrieving relevant documents, and decrease the liklihood of retrieving irrelevant documents.We can accomplish this using the Doctran library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to \"interrogate\" documents.See this notebook for benchmarks on vector similarity scores for various queries based on raw documents versus interrogated documents.pip install doctranimport jsonfrom langchain.schema import Documentfrom langchain.document_transformers import DoctranQATransformerfrom dotenv import load_dotenvload_dotenv()    TrueInput\u200bThis is the document we'll interrogatesample_text = \"\"\"[Generated with ChatGPT]Confidential Document - For Internal Use OnlyDate: July 1, 2023Subject: Updates and Discussions on Various TopicsDear Team,I hope this email finds you well.

'\\n\\n3'Where to pass in callbacks\u200bThe callbacks argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:Constructor callbacks: defined in the constructor, eg. LLMChain(callbacks=[handler], tags=['a-tag']), which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, eg. if you pass a handler to the LLMChain constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain.Request callbacks: defined in the run()/apply() methods used for issuing a request, eg. chain.run(input, callbacks=[handler]), which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the call() method).The verbose argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, eg. LLMChain(verbose=True), and it is equivalent to passing a ConsoleCallbackHandler to the callbacks argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.When do you want to use each of these?\u200bConstructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are not specific to a single request, but rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an LLMChain, you would pass a handler to the constructor.Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a websocket, you would pass a handler to the call() method",

        "page_content": "LangSmith WalkthroughLangChain makes it easy to prototype LLM applications and Agents. However, delivering LLM applications to production can be deceptively difficult. You will likely have to heavily customize and iterate on your prompts, chains, and other components to create a high-quality product.To aid in this process, we've launched LangSmith, a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring your LLM applications.When might this come in handy? You may find it useful when you want to:Quickly debug a new chain, agent, or set of toolsVisualize how components (chains, llms, retrievers, etc.) relate and are usedEvaluate different prompts and LLMs for a single componentRun a given chain several times over a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality barCapture usage traces and using LLMs or analytics pipelines to generate insightsPrerequisites\u200bCreate a LangSmith account and create an API key (see bottom left corner). Familiarize yourself with the platform by looking through the docsNote LangSmith is in closed beta; we're in the process of rolling it out to more users. However, you can fill out the form on the website for expedited access.Now, let's get started!Log runs to LangSmith\u200bFirst, configure your environment variables to tell LangChain to log traces. This is done by setting the LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 environment variable to true.\nYou can tell LangChain which project to log to by setting the LANGCHAIN_PROJECT environment variable (if this isn't set, runs will be logged to the default project). This will automatically create the project for you if it doesn't exist. You must also set the LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT and LANGCHAIN_API_KEY environment variables.For more information on other ways to set up tracing, please reference the LangSmith documentationNOTE: You must also set your OPENAI_API_KEY and SERPAPI_API_KEY environment variables in order to run the following tutorial.NOTE: You can only access an API key when you first create it. Keep it somewhere safe.NOTE: You can also use a context manager in python to log traces usingfrom langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabledwith tracing_v2_enabled(project_name=\"My Project\"):    agent.run(\"How many people live in canada as of 2023?\")However, in this example, we will use environment variables.import osfrom uuid import uuid4unique_id = uuid4().hex[0:8]os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_PROJECT\"] = f\"Tracing Walkthrough - {unique_id}\"os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT\"] = \"https://api.smith.langchain.com\"os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = \"\"  # Update to your API key# Used by the agent in this tutorial# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>\"# os.environ[\"SERPAPI_API_KEY\"] = \"<YOUR-SERPAPI-API-KEY>\"Create the langsmith client to interact with the APIfrom langsmith import Clientclient = Client()Create a LangChain component and log runs to the platform. In this example, we will create a ReAct-style agent with access to Search and Calculator as tools. However, LangSmith works regardless of which type of LangChain component you use (LLMs, Chat Models, Tools, Retrievers, Agents are all supported).from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_toolsllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)tools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)agent = initialize_agent(    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=False)We are running the agent concurrently on multiple inputs to reduce latency. Runs get logged to LangSmith in the background so execution latency is unaffected.import asyncioinputs = [    \"How many people live in canada as of 2023?\",    \"who is dua lipa's boyfriend? what is his age raised to the .43 power?\",    \"what is dua lipa's boyfriend age raised to the .43 power?\",    \"how far is it from paris to boston in miles\",    \"what was the total number of points scored in the 2023 super bowl? what is that number raised to the .23 power?\",    \"what was the total number of points scored in the 2023 super bowl raised to the .23 power?\",    \"how many more points were scored in the 2023 super bowl than in the 2022 super bowl?\",    \"what is 153 raised to .1312 power?\",    \"who is kendall jenner's boyfriend? what is his height (in inches) raised to .13 power?\",    \"what is 1213 divided by 4345?\",]results = []async def arun(agent, input_example):    try:        return await agent.arun(input_example)    except Exception as e:        # The agent sometimes makes mistakes!

This is also# useful for serverless deployments.wait_for_all_tracers()Assuming you've successfully set up your environment, your agent traces should show up in the Projects section in the app. Congrats!Evaluate another agent implementation\u200bIn addition to logging runs, LangSmith also allows you to test and evaluate your LLM applications.In this section, you will leverage LangSmith to create a benchmark dataset and run AI-assisted evaluators on an agent. You will do so in a few steps:Create a dataset from pre-existing run inputs and outputsInitialize a new agent to benchmarkConfigure evaluators to grade an agent's outputRun the agent over the dataset and evaluate the results1. Create a LangSmith dataset\u200bBelow, we use the LangSmith client to create a dataset from the agent runs you just logged above. You will use these later to measure performance for a new agent. This is simply taking the inputs and outputs of the runs and saving them as examples to a dataset. A dataset is a collection of examples, which are nothing more than input-output pairs you can use as test cases to your application.Note: this is a simple, walkthrough example. In a real-world setting, you'd ideally first validate the outputs before adding them to a benchmark dataset to be used for evaluating other agents.For more information on datasets, including how to create them from CSVs or other files or how to create them in the platform, please refer to the LangSmith documentation.dataset_name = f\"calculator-example-dataset-{unique_id}\"dataset = client.create_dataset(    dataset_name, description=\"A calculator example dataset\")runs = client.list_runs(    project_name=os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_PROJECT\"],    execution_order=1,  # Only return the top-level runs    error=False,  # Only runs that succeed)for run in runs:    client.create_example(inputs=run.inputs, outputs=run.outputs, dataset_id=dataset.id)2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark\u200bYou can evaluate any LLM, chain, or agent. Since chains can have memory, we will pass in a chain_factory (aka a constructor ) function to initialize for each call.In this case, we will test an agent that uses OpenAI's function calling endpoints.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_toolsllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\", temperature=0)tools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)# Since chains can be stateful (e.g. they can have memory), we provide# a way to initialize a new chain for each row in the dataset. This is done# by passing in a factory function that returns a new chain for each row.def agent_factory():    return initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, verbose=False)# If your chain is NOT stateful, your factory can return the object directly# to improve runtime performance. For example:# chain_factory = lambda: agent3. Configure evaluation\u200bManually comparing the results of chains in the UI is effective, but it can be time consuming.\nIt can be helpful to use automated metrics and AI-assisted feedback to evaluate your component's performance.Below, we will create some pre-implemented run evaluators that do the following:Compare results against ground truth labels. (You used the debug outputs above for this)Measure semantic (dis)similarity using embedding distanceEvaluate 'aspects' of the agent's response in a reference-free manner using custom criteriaFor a longer discussion of how to select an appropriate evaluator for your use case and how to create your own\ncustom evaluators, please refer to the LangSmith documentation.from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorTypefrom langchain.smith import RunEvalConfigevaluation_config = RunEvalConfig(    # Evaluators can either be an evaluator type (e.g., \"qa\", \"criteria\", \"embedding_distance\", etc.) or a configuration for that evaluator    evaluators=[        # Measures whether a QA response is \"Correct\", based on a reference answer        # You can also select via the raw string \"qa\"        EvaluatorType.QA,        # Measure the embedding distance between the output and the reference answer        # Equivalent to: EvalConfig.EmbeddingDistance(embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings())        EvaluatorType.EMBEDDING_DISTANCE,        # Grade whether the output satisfies the stated criteria.

This will:Fetch example rows from the specified datasetRun your llm or chain on each example.Apply evalutors to the resulting run traces and corresponding reference examples to generate automated feedback.The results will be visible in the LangSmith app.from langchain.smith import (    arun_on_dataset,    run_on_dataset,  # Available if your chain doesn't support async calls.)chain_results = await arun_on_dataset(    client=client,    dataset_name=dataset_name,    llm_or_chain_factory=agent_factory,    evaluation=evaluation_config,    verbose=True,    tags=[\"testing-notebook\"],  # Optional, adds a tag to the resulting chain runs)# Sometimes, the agent will error due to parsing issues, incompatible tool inputs, etc.# These are logged as warnings here and captured as errors in the tracing UI.

        "page_content": "QuickstartInstallation\u200bTo install LangChain run:PipCondapip install langchainconda install langchain -c conda-forgeFor more details, see our Installation guide.Environment setup\u200bUsing LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we'll use OpenAI's model APIs.First we'll need to install their Python package:pip install openaiAccessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:from langchain.llms import OpenAIllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\"...\")Building an application\u200bNow we can start building our language model application. LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications.\nModules can be used as stand-alones in simple applications and they can be combined for more complex use cases.The core building block of LangChain applications is the LLMChain.\nThis combines three things:LLM: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them.Prompt Templates: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial.Output Parsers: These translate the raw response from the LLM to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream.In this getting started guide we will cover those three components by themselves, and then cover the LLMChain which combines all of them.\nUnderstanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications.\nMost LangChain applications allow you to configure the LLM and/or the prompt used, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler.LLMs\u200bThere are two types of language models, which in LangChain are called:LLMs: this is a language model which takes a string as input and returns a stringChatModels: this is a language model which takes a list of messages as input and returns a messageThe input/output for LLMs is simple and easy to understand - a string.\nBut what about ChatModels? The input there is a list of ChatMessages, and the output is a single ChatMessage.\nA ChatMessage has two required components:content: This is the content of the message.role: This is the role of the entity from which the ChatMessage is coming from.LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles:HumanMessage: A ChatMessage coming from a human/user.AIMessage: A ChatMessage coming from an AI/assistant.SystemMessage: A ChatMessage coming from the system.FunctionMessage: A ChatMessage coming from a function call.If none of those roles sound right, there is also a ChatMessage class where you can specify the role manually.\nFor more information on how to use these different messages most effectively, see our prompting guide.LangChain exposes a standard interface for both, but it's useful to understand this difference in order to construct prompts for a given language model.\nThe standard interface that LangChain exposes has two methods:predict: Takes in a string, returns a stringpredict_messages: Takes in a list of messages, returns a message.Let's see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs.\nFirst, let's import an LLM and a ChatModel.from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIllm = OpenAI()chat_model = ChatOpenAI()llm.predict(\"hi!\")>>> \"Hi\"chat_model.predict(\"hi!\")>>> \"Hi\"The OpenAI and ChatOpenAI objects are basically just configuration objects.\nYou can initialize them with parameters like temperature and others, and pass them around.Next, let's use the predict method to run over a string input.text = \"What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?\"llm.predict(text)# >> Feetful of Funchat_model.predict(text)# >> Socks O'ColorFinally, let's use the predict_messages method to run over a list of messages.from langchain.schema import HumanMessagetext = \"What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?\"messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)]llm.predict_messages(messages)# >> Feetful of Funchat_model.predict_messages(messages)# >> Socks O'ColorFor both these methods, you can also pass in parameters as key word arguments.\nFor example, you could pass in temperature=0 to adjust the temperature that is used from what the object was configured with.\nWhatever values are passed in during run time will always override what the object was configured with.Prompt templates\u200bMost LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand.In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it'd be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions.PromptTemplates help with exactly this!\nThey bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt.\nThis can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be:from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplateprompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\")prompt.format(product=\"colorful socks\")What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several.\nYou can \"partial\" out variables - eg you can format only some of the variables at a time.\nYou can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt.\nFor explanations of these functionalities, see the section on prompts for more detail.PromptTemplates can also be used to produce a list of messages.\nIn this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc)\nHere, what happens most often is a ChatPromptTemplate is a list of ChatMessageTemplates.\nEach ChatMessageTemplate contains instructions for how to format that ChatMessage - its role, and then also its content.\nLet's take a look at this below:from langchain.prompts.chat import (    ChatPromptTemplate,    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)template = \"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\"system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)human_template = \"{text}\"human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\")[    SystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\", additional_kwargs={}),    HumanMessage(content=\"I love programming.\")]ChatPromptTemplates can also include other things besides ChatMessageTemplates - see the section on prompts for more detail.Output Parsers\u200bOutputParsers convert the raw output of an LLM into a format that can be used downstream.\nThere are few main type of OutputParsers, including:Convert text from LLM -> structured information (eg JSON)Convert a ChatMessage into just a stringConvert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string.For full information on this, see the section on output parsersIn this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list.from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParserclass CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):    \"\"\"Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list.\"\"\"    def parse(self, text: str):        \"\"\"Parse the output of an LLM call.\"\"\"        return text.strip().split(\", \")CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse(\"hi, bye\")# >> ['hi', 'bye']LLMChain\u200bWe can now combine all these into one chain.\nThis chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to an LLM, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser.\nThis is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic.\nLet's see it in action!from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (    ChatPromptTemplate,    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)from langchain.chains import LLMChainfrom langchain.schema import BaseOutputParserclass CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):    \"\"\"Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list.\"\"\"    def parse(self, text: str):        \"\"\"Parse the output of an LLM call.\"\"\"        return text.strip().split(\", \")template = \"\"\"You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists.A user will pass in a category, and you should generated 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list.ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more.\"\"\"system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)human_template = \"{text}\"human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])chain = LLMChain(    llm=ChatOpenAI(),    prompt=chat_prompt,    output_parser=CommaSeparatedListOutputParser())chain.run(\"colors\")# >> ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']Next Steps\u200bThis is it!\nWe've now gone over how to create the core building block of LangChain applications - the LLMChains.\nThere is a lot more nuance in all these components (LLMs, prompts, output parsers) and a lot more different components to learn about as well.\nTo continue on your journey:Dive deeper into LLMs, prompts, and output parsersLearn the other key componentsCheck out our helpful guides for detailed walkthroughs on particular topicsExplore end-to-end use cases",

        "page_content": "DeploymentIn today's fast-paced technological landscape, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding. As a result, it's crucial for developers to understand how to effectively deploy these models in production environments. LLM interfaces typically fall into two categories:Case 1: Utilizing External LLM Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\nIn this scenario, most of the computational burden is handled by the LLM providers, while LangChain simplifies the implementation of business logic around these services. This approach includes features such as prompt templating, chat message generation, caching, vector embedding database creation, preprocessing, etc.Case 2: Self-hosted Open-Source Models\nAlternatively, developers can opt to use smaller, yet comparably capable, self-hosted open-source LLM models. This approach can significantly decrease costs, latency, and privacy concerns associated with transferring data to external LLM providers.Regardless of the framework that forms the backbone of your product, deploying LLM applications comes with its own set of challenges. It's vital to understand the trade-offs and key considerations when evaluating serving frameworks.Outline\u200bThis guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for deploying LLMs in a production setting, focusing on:Designing a Robust LLM Application ServiceMaintaining Cost-EfficiencyEnsuring Rapid IterationUnderstanding these components is crucial when assessing serving systems. LangChain integrates with several open-source projects designed to tackle these issues, providing a robust framework for productionizing your LLM applications. Some notable frameworks include:Ray ServeBentoMLOpenLLMModalJinaThese links will provide further information on each ecosystem, assisting you in finding the best fit for your LLM deployment needs.Designing a Robust LLM Application Service\u200bWhen deploying an LLM service in production, it's imperative to provide a seamless user experience free from outages. Achieving 24/7 service availability involves creating and maintaining several sub-systems surrounding your application.Monitoring\u200bMonitoring forms an integral part of any system running in a production environment. In the context of LLMs, it is essential to monitor both performance and quality metrics.Performance Metrics: These metrics provide insights into the efficiency and capacity of your model. Here are some key examples:Query per second (QPS): This measures the number of queries your model processes in a second, offering insights into its utilization.Latency: This metric quantifies the delay from when your client sends a request to when they receive a response.Tokens Per Second (TPS): This represents the number of tokens your model can generate in a second.Quality Metrics: These metrics are typically customized according to the business use-case. For instance, how does the output of your system compare to a baseline, such as a previous version? Although these metrics can be calculated offline, you need to log the necessary data to use them later.Fault tolerance\u200bYour application may encounter errors such as exceptions in your model inference or business logic code, causing failures and disrupting traffic. Other potential issues could arise from the machine running your application, such as unexpected hardware breakdowns or loss of spot-instances during high-demand periods. One way to mitigate these risks is by increasing redundancy through replica scaling and implementing recovery mechanisms for failed replicas. However, model replicas aren't the only potential points of failure. It's essential to build resilience against various failures that could occur at any point in your stack.Zero down time upgrade\u200bSystem upgrades are often necessary but can result in service disruptions if not handled correctly. One way to prevent downtime during upgrades is by implementing a smooth transition process from the old version to the new one. Ideally, the new version of your LLM service is deployed, and traffic gradually shifts from the old to the new version, maintaining a constant QPS throughout the process.Load balancing\u200bLoad balancing, in simple terms, is a technique to distribute work evenly across multiple computers, servers, or other resources to optimize the utilization of the system, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Think of it as a traffic officer directing cars (requests) to different roads (servers) so that no single road becomes too congested.There are several strategies for load balancing. For example, one common method is the Round Robin strategy, where each request is sent to the next server in line, cycling back to the first when all servers have received a request. This works well when all servers are equally capable. However, if some servers are more powerful than others, you might use a Weighted Round Robin or Least Connections strategy, where more requests are sent to the more powerful servers, or to those currently handling the fewest active requests. Let's imagine you're running a LLM chain. If your application becomes popular, you could have hundreds or even thousands of users asking questions at the same time. If one server gets too busy (high load), the load balancer would direct new requests to another server that is less busy. This way, all your users get a timely response and the system remains stable.Maintaining Cost-Efficiency and Scalability\u200bDeploying LLM services can be costly, especially when you're handling a large volume of user interactions. Charges by LLM providers are usually based on tokens used, making a chat system inference on these models potentially expensive. However, several strategies can help manage these costs without compromising the quality of the service.Self-hosting models\u200bSeveral smaller and open-source LLMs are emerging to tackle the issue of reliance on LLM providers. Self-hosting allows you to maintain similar quality to LLM provider models while managing costs. The challenge lies in building a reliable, high-performing LLM serving system on your own machines. Resource Management and Auto-Scaling\u200bComputational logic within your application requires precise resource allocation. For instance, if part of your traffic is served by an OpenAI endpoint and another part by a self-hosted model, it's crucial to allocate suitable resources for each. Auto-scaling\u2014adjusting resource allocation based on traffic\u2014can significantly impact the cost of running your application. This strategy requires a balance between cost and responsiveness, ensuring neither resource over-provisioning nor compromised application responsiveness.Utilizing Spot Instances\u200bOn platforms like AWS, spot instances offer substantial cost savings, typically priced at about a third of on-demand instances. The trade-off is a higher crash rate, necessitating a robust fault-tolerance mechanism for effective use.Independent Scaling\u200bWhen self-hosting your models, you should consider independent scaling. For example, if you have two translation models, one fine-tuned for French and another for Spanish, incoming requests might necessitate different scaling requirements for each.Batching requests\u200bIn the context of Large Language Models, batching requests can enhance efficiency by better utilizing your GPU resources. GPUs are inherently parallel processors, designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. If you send individual requests to the model, the GPU might not be fully utilized as it's only working on a single task at a time. On the other hand, by batching requests together, you're allowing the GPU to work on multiple tasks at once, maximizing its utilization and improving inference speed. This not only leads to cost savings but can also improve the overall latency of your LLM service.In summary, managing costs while scaling your LLM services requires a strategic approach. Utilizing self-hosting models, managing resources effectively, employing auto-scaling, using spot instances, independently scaling models, and batching requests are key strategies to consider. Open-source libraries such as Ray Serve and BentoML are designed to deal with these complexities. Ensuring Rapid Iteration\u200bThe LLM landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with new libraries and model architectures being introduced constantly. Consequently, it's crucial to avoid tying yourself to a solution specific to one particular framework. This is especially relevant in serving, where changes to your infrastructure can be time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Strive for infrastructure that is not locked into any specific machine learning library or framework, but instead offers a general-purpose, scalable serving layer. Here are some aspects where flexibility plays a key role:Model composition\u200bDeploying systems like LangChain demands the ability to piece together different models and connect them via logic. Take the example of building a natural language input SQL query engine. Querying an LLM and obtaining the SQL command is only part of the system. You need to extract metadata from the connected database, construct a prompt for the LLM, run the SQL query on an engine, collect and feed back the response to the LLM as the query runs, and present the results to the user. This demonstrates the need to seamlessly integrate various complex components built in Python into a dynamic chain of logical blocks that can be served together.Cloud providers\u200bMany hosted solutions are restricted to a single cloud provider, which can limit your options in today's multi-cloud world. Depending on where your other infrastructure components are built, you might prefer to stick with your chosen cloud provider.Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\u200bRapid iteration also involves the ability to recreate your infrastructure quickly and reliably. This is where Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Kubernetes YAML files come into play. They allow you to define your infrastructure in code files, which can be version controlled and quickly deployed, enabling faster and more reliable iterations.CI/CD\u200bIn a fast-paced environment, implementing CI/CD pipelines can significantly speed up the iteration process. They help automate the testing and deployment of your LLM applications, reducing the risk of errors and enabling faster feedback and iteration.",

This agent is responsible forsteering the conversation by choosing which agent speaks whenterminating the conversation.In order to implement such an agent, we need to solve several problems.First, to steer the conversation, the DirectorDialogueAgent needs to (1) reflect on what has been said, (2) choose the next agent, and (3) prompt the next agent to speak, all in a single message. While it may be possible to prompt an LLM to perform all three steps in the same call, this requires writing custom code to parse the outputted message to extract which next agent is chosen to speak. This is less reliable the LLM can express how it chooses the next agent in different ways.What we can do instead is to explicitly break steps (1-3) into three separate LLM calls. First we will ask the DirectorDialogueAgent to reflect on the conversation so far and generate a response. Then we prompt the DirectorDialogueAgent to output the index of the next agent, which is easily parseable. Lastly, we pass the name of the selected next agent back to DirectorDialogueAgent to ask it prompt the next agent to speak. Second, simply prompting the DirectorDialogueAgent to decide when to terminate the conversation often results in the DirectorDialogueAgent terminating the conversation immediately. To fix this problem, we randomly sample a Bernoulli variable to decide whether the conversation should terminate.

I mean, who needs to break a sweat when you can just sit your way to victory? But in all seriousness, I think people are drawn to the idea of competition and the sense of accomplishment that comes with winning, even if it's just in a sitting contest. Plus, let's be real, sitting is something we all excel at. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, what do you think about the impact of social media on the rise of competitive sitting?            (Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good social media trend. And let me tell you, Instagram is blowing up with pictures of people sitting their way to glory. It's like the ultimate humble brag. \"Oh, just won my third sitting competition this week, no big deal.\" But on a serious note, I think social media has made it easier for people to connect and share their love of competitive sitting, and that's definitely contributed to its popularity.

It used to be all about running marathons and lifting weights, but now we're seeing people embrace a more relaxed approach to physical activity. Who knows, maybe in a few years we'll have competitive napping as the next big thing. *leans back in chair* I could definitely get behind that. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, I'm curious to hear your take on the rise of competitive sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your own exercise routine or those of people around you?            (Ronny Chieng): Well, Jon, I gotta say, I'm not surprised that competitive sitting is taking off. I mean, have you seen the size of the chairs these days? They're practically begging us to sit in them all day. And as for exercise routines, let's just say I've never been one for the gym. But I can definitely see the appeal of sitting competitions. It's like a sport for the rest of us. Plus, I think it's a great way to bond with friends and family. Who needs a game of catch when you can have a sit-off?                Stop?

Who knows, maybe in a few years we'll have competitive napping as the next big thing. *leans back in chair* I could definitely get behind that. Aasif, as our CIA correspondent, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the potential national security implications of competitive sitting. Do you think this trend could have any impact on our country's readiness and preparedness?            (Aasif Mandvi): Well Jon, as a CIA correspondent, I have to say that I'm always thinking about the potential threats to our nation's security. And while competitive sitting may seem harmless, there could be some unforeseen consequences. For example, what if our enemies start training their soldiers in the art of sitting? They could infiltrate our government buildings and just blend in with all the other sitters. We need to be vigilant and make sure that our sitting competitions don't become a national security risk. *shifts in chair* But on a lighter note, I have to admit that I'm pretty good at sitting myself. Maybe I should start training for the next competition.                Stop? False            Next speaker: Ronny Chieng        (Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. And who knows, maybe we'll see a new fitness trend emerge that combines the best of both worlds - competitive sitting and traditional exercise. *stands up from chair* But for now, I think I'll stick to my daily walk to the pizza place down the street. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing emphasis on convenience and instant gratification?            (Ronny Chieng): Absolutely, Jon. We live in a world where everything is at our fingertips, and we expect things to be easy and convenient. So it's no surprise that people are drawn to a fitness trend that requires minimal effort and can be done from the comfort of their own homes. But I think it's important to remember that there's no substitute for real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our overall health and well-being. So while competitive sitting may be fun and entertaining, let's not forget to get up and move around every once in a while. *stands up from chair and stretches*                Stop? False            Next speaker: Samantha Bee        (Jon Stewart): It's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. That's a great point, Ronny. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing desire for instant gratification and convenience? Or is there something deeper at play here?            (Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good conspiracy theory. And let me tell you, I think there's something more sinister at play here. I mean, think about it - what if the government is behind this whole competitive sitting trend? They want us to be lazy and complacent so we don't question their actions. It's like the ultimate mind control. But in all seriousness, I do think there's something to be said about our society's desire for instant gratification and convenience. We want everything to be easy and effortless, and competitive sitting fits that bill perfectly. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. *stands up from chair and does a few stretches*                Stop? True        (Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. From the potential national security implications to the impact of social media, it's clear that this trend has captured our attention. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. Whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. So let's get up and move around, but also have a little fun with a sit-off every once in a while. Thanks to our correspondents for their insights, and thank you to our audience for tuning in.

Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to it's underlying VectorStore. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documented, but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.Get started\u200bWe'll use a Pinecone vector store in this example.First we'll want to create a Pinecone VectorStore and seed it with some data. We've created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.To use Pinecone, you to have pinecone package installed and you must have an API key and an Environment. Here are the installation instructions.NOTE: The self-query retriever requires you to have lark package installed.# !pip install lark pinecone-clientimport osimport pineconepinecone.init(api_key=os.environ[\"PINECONE_API_KEY\"], environment=os.environ[\"PINECONE_ENV\"])from langchain.schema import Documentfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Pineconeembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()# create new indexpinecone.create_index(\"langchain-self-retriever-demo\", dimension=1536)docs = [    Document(page_content=\"A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\", metadata={\"year\": 1993, \"rating\": 7.7, \"genre\": [\"action\", \"science fiction\"]}),    Document(page_content=\"Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...\", metadata={\"year\": 2010, \"director\": \"Christopher Nolan\", \"rating\": 8.2}),    Document(page_content=\"A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\", metadata={\"year\": 2006, \"director\": \"Satoshi Kon\", \"rating\": 8.6}),    Document(page_content=\"A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\", metadata={\"year\": 2019, \"director\": \"Greta Gerwig\", \"rating\": 8.3}),    Document(page_content=\"Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\", metadata={\"year\": 1995, \"genre\": \"animated\"}),    Document(page_content=\"Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\", metadata={\"year\": 1979, \"rating\": 9.9, \"director\": \"Andrei Tarkovsky\", \"genre\": [\"science fiction\", \"thriller\"], \"rating\": 9.9})]vectorstore = Pinecone.from_documents(    docs, embeddings, index_name=\"langchain-self-retriever-demo\")Creating our self-querying retriever\u200bNow we can instantiate our retriever.

The current url format limits the connection string to one sentinel host only (no list can be given) and\nbooth Redis server and sentinel must have the same password set (if used).Redis Cluster connection url\u200bRedis cluster is not supported right now for all methods requiring a \"redis_url\" parameter.\nThe only way to use a Redis Cluster is with LangChain classes accepting a preconfigured Redis client like RedisCache\n(example below).Cache\u200bThe Cache wrapper allows for Redis to be used as a remote, low-latency, in-memory cache for LLM prompts and responses.Standard Cache\u200bThe standard cache is the Redis bread & butter of use case in production for both open source and enterprise users globally.To import this cache:from langchain.cache import RedisCacheTo use this cache with your LLMs:import langchainimport redisredis_client = redis.Redis.from_url(...)langchain.llm_cache = RedisCache(redis_client)Semantic Cache\u200bSemantic caching allows users to retrieve cached prompts based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. Under the hood it blends Redis as both a cache and a vectorstore.To import this cache:from langchain.cache import RedisSemanticCacheTo use this cache with your LLMs:import langchainimport redis# use any embedding provider...from tests.integration_tests.vectorstores.fake_embeddings import FakeEmbeddingsredis_url = \"redis://localhost:6379\"langchain.llm_cache = RedisSemanticCache(    embedding=FakeEmbeddings(),    redis_url=redis_url)VectorStore\u200bThe vectorstore wrapper turns Redis into a low-latency vector database for semantic search or LLM content retrieval.To import this vectorstore:from langchain.vectorstores import RedisFor a more detailed walkthrough of the Redis vectorstore wrapper, see this notebook.Retriever\u200bThe Redis vector store retriever wrapper generalizes the vectorstore class to perform low-latency document retrieval. To create the retriever, simply call .as_retriever() on the base vectorstore class.Memory\u200bRedis can be used to persist LLM conversations.Vector Store Retriever Memory\u200bFor a more detailed walkthrough of the VectorStoreRetrieverMemory wrapper, see this notebook.Chat Message History Memory\u200bFor a detailed example of Redis to cache conversation message history, see this notebook.",

Remember, time is of the essence as Voldemort's power grows stronger every day. Good luck.            (Harry Potter): I suggest we sneak into the Forbidden Forest under the cover of darkness. Ron, Hermione, and I can use our wands to create a Disillusionment Charm to make us invisible. Filch, you can keep watch for any signs of danger. Let's move quickly and quietly.            (Dungeon Master): As you make your way through the Forbidden Forest, you hear the eerie sounds of nocturnal creatures. Suddenly, you come across a clearing where Aragog and his spider minions are waiting for you. Ron, Hermione, and Harry, you must use your wands to cast spells to fend off the spiders while Filch keeps watch. Be careful not to get bitten!            (Ron Weasley): I'll cast a spell to create a fiery blast to scare off the spiders. *I wave my wand and shout \"Incendio!\"* Hopefully, that will give us enough time to find the horcrux and get out of here safely.            (Dungeon Master): Ron's spell creates a burst of flames, causing the spiders to scurry away in fear. You quickly search the area and find a small, ornate box hidden in a crevice. Congratulations, you have found one of Voldemort's horcruxes! But beware, the Dark Lord's minions will stop at nothing to get it back.            (Hermione Granger): We need to destroy this horcrux as soon as possible. I suggest we use the Sword of Gryffindor to do it. Harry, do you still have it with you? We can use Fiendfyre to destroy it, but we need to be careful not to let the flames get out of control. Ron, can you help me create a protective barrier around us while Harry uses the sword?                (Dungeon Master): Harry retrieves the Sword of Gryffindor from his bag and holds it tightly. Hermione and Ron cast a protective barrier around the group as Harry uses the sword to destroy the horcrux with a swift strike. The box shatters into a million pieces, and a dark energy dissipates into the air. Well done, but there are still six more horcruxes to find and destroy. The hunt continues.            (Argus Filch): *I keep watch, making sure no one is following us.* I'll also keep an eye out for any signs of danger. Mrs. Norris, my trusty companion, will help me sniff out any trouble. We'll make sure the group stays safe while they search for the remaining horcruxes.            (Dungeon Master): As you continue on your quest, Filch and Mrs. Norris alert you to a group of Death Eaters approaching. You must act quickly to defend yourselves. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, use your wands to cast spells while Filch and Mrs. Norris keep watch. Remember, the fate of the wizarding world rests on your success.            (Harry Potter): I'll cast a spell to create a shield around us. *I wave my wand and shout \"Protego!\"* Ron and Hermione, you focus on attacking the Death Eaters with your spells. We need to work together to defeat them and protect the remaining horcruxes. Filch, keep watch and let us know if there are any more approaching.            (Dungeon Master): Harry's shield protects the group from the Death Eaters' spells as Ron and Hermione launch their own attacks. The Death Eaters are no match for the combined power of the trio and are quickly defeated. You continue on your journey, knowing that the next horcrux could be just around the corner. Keep your wits about you, for the Dark Lord's minions are always watching.            (Ron Weasley): I suggest we split up to cover more ground. Harry and I can search the Forbidden Forest while Hermione and Filch search Hogwarts. We can use our wands to communicate with each other and meet back up once we find a horcrux. Let's move quickly and stay alert for any danger.            (Dungeon Master): As the group splits up, Harry and Ron make their way deeper into the Forbidden Forest while Hermione and Filch search the halls of Hogwarts. Suddenly, Harry and Ron come across a group of dementors. They must use their Patronus charms to fend them off while Hermione and Filch rush to their aid. Remember, the power of friendship and teamwork is crucial in this quest.            (Hermione Granger): I hear Harry and Ron's Patronus charms from afar. We need to hurry and help them. Filch, can you use your knowledge of Hogwarts to find a shortcut to their location? I'll prepare a spell to repel the dementors. We need to work together to protect each other and find the next horcrux.                (Dungeon Master): Filch leads Hermione to a hidden passageway that leads to Harry and Ron's location. Hermione's spell repels the dementors, and the group is reunited. They continue their search, knowing that every moment counts. The fate of the wizarding world rests on their success.            (Argus Filch): *I keep watch as the group searches for the next horcrux.* Mrs. Norris and I will make sure no one is following us. We need to stay alert and work together to find the remaining horcruxes before it's too late. The Dark Lord's power grows stronger every day, and we must not let him win.            (Dungeon Master): As the group continues their search, they come across a hidden room in the depths of Hogwarts. Inside, they find a locket that they suspect is another one of Voldemort's horcruxes. But the locket is cursed, and they must work together to break the curse before they can destroy it. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, use your combined knowledge and skills to break the curse while Filch and Mrs. Norris keep watch. Time is running out, and the fate of the wizarding world rests on your success.            (Harry Potter): I'll use my knowledge of dark magic to try and break the curse on the locket. Ron and Hermione, you can help me by using your wands to channel your magic into mine. We need to work together and stay focused. Filch, keep watch and let us know if there are any signs of danger.    Dungeon Master: Harry, Ron, and Hermione combine their magical abilities to break the curse on the locket. The locket opens, revealing a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry uses the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy it, and the group feels a sense of relief knowing that they are one step closer to defeating the Dark Lord. But there are still four more horcruxes to find and destroy. The hunt continues.            (Dungeon Master): As the group continues their quest, they face even greater challenges and dangers. But with their unwavering determination and teamwork, they press on, knowing that the fate of the wizarding world rests on their success. Will they be able to find and destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes before it's too late? Only time will tell.            (Ron Weasley): We can't give up now. We've come too far to let Voldemort win. Let's keep searching and fighting until we destroy all of his horcruxes and defeat him once and for all. We can do this together.            (Dungeon Master): The group nods in agreement, their determination stronger than ever. They continue their search, facing challenges and obstacles at every turn. But they know that they must not give up, for the fate of the wizarding world rests on their success. The hunt for Voldemort's horcruxes continues, and the end is in sight.        ",

Marqo can scale to hundred-million document indexes with horizontal index sharding and allows for async and non-blocking data upload and search. Marqo uses the latest machine learning models from PyTorch, Huggingface, OpenAI and more. You can start with a pre-configured model or bring your own. The built in ONNX support and conversion allows for faster inference and higher throughput on both CPU and GPU.Because Marqo include its own inference your documents can have a mix of text and images, you can bring Marqo indexes with data from your other systems into the langchain ecosystem without having to worry about your embeddings being compatible. Deployment of Marqo is flexible, you can get started yourself with our docker image or contact us about our managed cloud offering!To run Marqo locally with our docker image, see our getting started.Installation and Setup\u200bInstall the Python SDK with pip install marqoWrappers\u200bVectorStore\u200bThere exists a wrapper around Marqo indexes, allowing you to use them within the vectorstore framework. Marqo lets you select from a range of models for generating embeddings and exposes some preprocessing configurations.The Marqo vectorstore can also work with existing multimodel indexes where your documents have a mix of images and text, for more information refer to our documentation. Note that instaniating the Marqo vectorstore with an existing multimodal index will disable the ability to add any new documents to it via the langchain vectorstore add_texts method.To import this vectorstore:from langchain.vectorstores import MarqoFor a more detailed walkthrough of the Marqo wrapper and some of its unique features, see this notebook",

LangChain#\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling\\ndevelopers to build applications that they previously could not.\\nBut using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to\\ncreate a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to\\ncombine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include:\\n\u2753 Question Answering over specific documents\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\n\\n\ud83d\udcac Chatbots\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\n\\n\ud83e\udd16 Agents\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\nGetting Started Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\n\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\n\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain\u2019s reference documentation, in one place.

LangChain#\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\n\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\n\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\nGetting Started Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\n\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent.

LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\n\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information.

The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements.Import the beautifulsoup4 library and define the custom function.pip install beautifulsoup4from bs4 import BeautifulSoupdef remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str:    # Find all 'nav' and 'header' elements in the BeautifulSoup object    nav_elements = content.find_all(\"nav\")    header_elements = content.find_all(\"header\")    # Remove each 'nav' and 'header' element from the BeautifulSoup object    for element in nav_elements + header_elements:        element.decompose()    return str(content.get_text())Add your custom function to the SitemapLoader object.loader = SitemapLoader(    \"https://langchain.readthedocs.io/sitemap.xml\",    filter_urls=[\"https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/\"],    parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements,)Local Sitemap\u200bThe sitemap loader can also be used to load local files.sitemap_loader = SitemapLoader(web_path=\"example_data/sitemap.xml\", is_local=True)docs = sitemap_loader.load()    Fetching pages: 100%|####################################################################################################################################| 3/3 [00:00<00:00,  3.91it/s]",

        "page_content": "FLAREThis notebook is an implementation of Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE).Please see the original repo here.The basic idea is:Start answering a questionIf you start generating tokens the model is uncertain about, look up relevant documentsUse those documents to continue generatingRepeat until finishedThere is a lot of cool detail in how the lookup of relevant documents is done.\nBasically, the tokens that model is uncertain about are highlighted, and then an LLM is called to generate a question that would lead to that answer. For example, if the generated text is Joe Biden went to Harvard, and the tokens the model was uncertain about was Harvard, then a good generated question would be where did Joe Biden go to college. This generated question is then used in a retrieval step to fetch relevant documents.In order to set up this chain, we will need three things:An LLM to generate the answerAn LLM to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrievalA retriever to use to look up answers forThe LLM that we use to generate the answer needs to return logprobs so we can identify uncertain tokens. For that reason, we HIGHLY recommend that you use the OpenAI wrapper (NB: not the ChatOpenAI wrapper, as that does not return logprobs).The LLM we use to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval can be anything. In this notebook we will use ChatOpenAI because it is fast and cheap.The retriever can be anything. In this notebook we will use SERPER search engine, because it is cheap.Other important parameters to understand:max_generation_len: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping to check if any are uncertainmin_prob: Any tokens generated with probability below this will be considered uncertainImports\u200bimport osos.environ[\"SERPER_API_KEY\"] = \"\"os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"import reimport numpy as npfrom langchain.schema import BaseRetrieverfrom langchain.callbacks.manager import (    AsyncCallbackManagerForRetrieverRun,    CallbackManagerForRetrieverRun,)from langchain.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapperfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.schema import Documentfrom typing import Any, ListRetriever\u200bclass SerperSearchRetriever(BaseRetriever):    search: GoogleSerperAPIWrapper = None    def _get_relevant_documents(        self, query: str, *, run_manager: CallbackManagerForRetrieverRun, **kwargs: Any    ) -> List[Document]:        return [Document(page_content=self.search.run(query))]    async def _aget_relevant_documents(        self,        query: str,        *,        run_manager: AsyncCallbackManagerForRetrieverRun,        **kwargs: Any,    ) -> List[Document]:        raise NotImplementedError()retriever = SerperSearchRetriever(search=GoogleSerperAPIWrapper())FLARE Chain\u200b# We set this so we can see what exactly is going onimport langchainlangchain.verbose = Truefrom langchain.chains import FlareChainflare = FlareChain.from_llm(    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),    retriever=retriever,    max_generation_len=164,    min_prob=0.3,)query = \"explain in great detail the difference between the langchain framework and baby agi\"flare.run(query)            > Entering new FlareChain chain...

BabyAGI is an AI agent that can generate and pretend to execute tasks based on a given objective.This guide will help you understand the components to create your own recursive agents.Although BabyAGI uses specific vectorstores/model providers (Pinecone, OpenAI), one of the benefits of implementing it with LangChain is that you can easily swap those out for different options. In this implementation we use a FAISS vectorstore (because it runs locally and is free).Install and Import Required Modules\u200bimport osfrom collections import dequefrom typing import Dict, List, Optional, Anyfrom langchain import LLMChain, OpenAI, PromptTemplatefrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.llms import BaseLLMfrom langchain.vectorstores.base import VectorStorefrom pydantic import BaseModel, Fieldfrom langchain.chains.base import ChainConnect to the Vector Store\u200bDepending on what vectorstore you use, this step may look different.from langchain.vectorstores import FAISSfrom langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore# Define your embedding modelembeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()# Initialize the vectorstore as emptyimport faissembedding_size = 1536index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})Define the Chains\u200bBabyAGI relies on three LLM chains:Task creation chain to select new tasks to add to the listTask prioritization chain to re-prioritize tasksExecution Chain to execute the tasksclass TaskCreationChain(LLMChain):    \"\"\"Chain to generates tasks.\"\"\"    @classmethod    def from_llm(cls, llm: BaseLLM, verbose: bool = True) -> LLMChain:        \"\"\"Get the response parser.\"\"\"        task_creation_template = (            \"You are a task creation AI that uses the result of an execution agent\"            \" to create new tasks with the following objective: {objective},\"            \" The last completed task has the result: {result}.\"            \" This result was based on this task description: {task_description}.\"            \" These are incomplete tasks: {incomplete_tasks}.\"            \" Based on the result, create new tasks to be completed\"            \" by the AI system that do not overlap with incomplete tasks.\"            \" Return the tasks as an array.\"        )        prompt = PromptTemplate(            template=task_creation_template,            input_variables=[                \"result\",                \"task_description\",                \"incomplete_tasks\",                \"objective\",            ],        )        return cls(prompt=prompt, llm=llm, verbose=verbose)class TaskPrioritizationChain(LLMChain):    \"\"\"Chain to prioritize tasks.\"\"\"    @classmethod    def from_llm(cls, llm: BaseLLM, verbose: bool = True) -> LLMChain:        \"\"\"Get the response parser.\"\"\"        task_prioritization_template = (            \"You are a task prioritization AI tasked with cleaning the formatting of and reprioritizing\"            \" the following tasks: {task_names}.\"            \" Consider the ultimate objective of your team: {objective}.\"            \" Do not remove any tasks.

Black body radiation is the emission of electromagnetic radiation from a body due to its temperature. It is a type of thermal radiation that is emitted from the surface of all objects that are at a temperature above absolute zero. It is a spectrum of radiation that is influenced by the temperature of the body and is independent of the composition of the emitting material.print(chain.run(\"What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3\"))            > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...    math: {'input': 'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3'}    > Finished chain.    ?        The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. To solve this problem, we can break down the question into two parts: finding the first prime number greater than 40, and then finding a number that is divisible by 3.         The first step is to find the first prime number greater than 40. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The next prime number after 40 is 41.        The second step is to find a number that is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add 1 to 41, which gives us 42. Now, we can check if 42 is divisible by 3. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 42 is divisible by 3.        Therefore, the answer to the question is 43.print(chain.run(\"What is the name of the type of cloud that rins\"))            > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...

        "page_content": "Memory\ud83d\udea7 Docs under construction \ud83d\udea7infoHead to Integrations for documentation on built-in memory integrations with 3rd-party tools.By default, Chains and Agents are stateless,\nmeaning that they treat each incoming query independently (like the underlying LLMs and chat models themselves).\nIn some applications, like chatbots, it is essential\nto remember previous interactions, both in the short and long-term.\nThe Memory class does exactly that.LangChain provides memory components in two forms.\nFirst, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages.\nThese are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used.\nSecondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.Get started\u200bMemory involves keeping a concept of state around throughout a user's interactions with an language model. A user's interactions with a language model are captured in the concept of ChatMessages, so this boils down to ingesting, capturing, transforming and extracting knowledge from a sequence of chat messages. There are many different ways to do this, each of which exists as its own memory type.In general, for each type of memory there are two ways to understanding using memory. These are the standalone functions which extract information from a sequence of messages, and then there is the way you can use this type of memory in a chain.Memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages). The returned information can either be a string or a list of messages.We will walk through the simplest form of memory: \"buffer\" memory, which just involves keeping a buffer of all prior messages. We will show how to use the modular utility functions here, then show how it can be used in a chain (both returning a string as well as a list of messages).ChatMessageHistory\u200bOne of the core utility classes underpinning most (if not all) memory modules is the ChatMessageHistory class. This is a super lightweight wrapper which exposes convenience methods for saving Human messages, AI messages, and then fetching them all.You may want to use this class directly if you are managing memory outside of a chain.from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistoryhistory = ChatMessageHistory()history.add_user_message(\"hi!\")history.add_ai_message(\"whats up?\")history.messages    [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),     AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]ConversationBufferMemory\u200bWe now show how to use this simple concept in a chain. We first showcase ConversationBufferMemory which is just a wrapper around ChatMessageHistory that extracts the messages in a variable.We can first extract it as a string.from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemorymemory = ConversationBufferMemory()memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(\"hi!\")memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(\"whats up?\")memory.load_memory_variables({})    {'history': 'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?'}We can also get the history as a list of messagesmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(\"hi!\")memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(\"whats up?\")memory.load_memory_variables({})    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),      AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]}Using in a chain\u200bFinally, let's take a look at using this in a chain (setting verbose=True so we can see the prompt).from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChainllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)conversation = ConversationChain(    llm=llm,    verbose=True,    memory=ConversationBufferMemory())conversation.predict(input=\"Hi there!\")    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

This can be done easily by first converting the messages to normal python dictionaries, saving those (as json or something) and then loading those. Here is an example of doing that.import jsonfrom langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain.schema import messages_from_dict, messages_to_dicthistory = ChatMessageHistory()history.add_user_message(\"hi!\")history.add_ai_message(\"whats up?\")dicts = messages_to_dict(history.messages)dicts    [{'type': 'human', 'data': {'content': 'hi!', 'additional_kwargs': {}}},     {'type': 'ai', 'data': {'content': 'whats up?', 'additional_kwargs': {}}}]new_messages = messages_from_dict(dicts)new_messages    [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),     AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]And that's it for the getting started!

For a more detailed walkthrough of these types, please see this notebook.There are two ways to load different chain types. First, you can specify the chain type argument in the from_chain_type method. This allows you to pass in the name of the chain type you want to use. For example, in the below we change the chain type to map_reduce.qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"map_reduce\", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"qa.run(query)    \" The president said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of our nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice and a former federal public defender, from a family of public school educators and police officers, a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\"The above way allows you to really simply change the chain_type, but it doesn't provide a ton of flexibility over parameters to that chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in this notebook) and then pass that directly to the the RetrievalQA chain with the combine_documents_chain parameter. For example:from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chainqa_chain = load_qa_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=\"stuff\")qa = RetrievalQA(combine_documents_chain=qa_chain, retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"qa.run(query)    \" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers.

This notebook covers how to do that.For this notebook, we will add a custom memory type to ConversationChain. In order to add a custom memory class, we need to import the base memory class and subclass it.from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChainfrom langchain.schema import BaseMemoryfrom pydantic import BaseModelfrom typing import List, Dict, AnyIn this example, we will write a custom memory class that uses spacy to extract entities and save information about them in a simple hash table. Then, during the conversation, we will look at the input text, extract any entities, and put any information about them into the context.Please note that this implementation is pretty simple and brittle and probably not useful in a production setting. Its purpose is to showcase that you can add custom memory implementations.For this, we will need spacy.# !pip install spacy# !python -m spacy download en_core_web_lgimport spacynlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_lg\")class SpacyEntityMemory(BaseMemory, BaseModel):    \"\"\"Memory class for storing information about entities.\"\"\"    # Define dictionary to store information about entities.    entities: dict = {}    # Define key to pass information about entities into prompt.    memory_key: str = \"entities\"    def clear(self):        self.entities = {}    @property    def memory_variables(self) -> List[str]:        \"\"\"Define the variables we are providing to the prompt.\"\"\"        return [self.memory_key]    def load_memory_variables(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, str]:        \"\"\"Load the memory variables, in this case the entity key.\"\"\"        # Get the input text and run through spacy        doc = nlp(inputs[list(inputs.keys())[0]])        # Extract known information about entities, if they exist.        entities = [            self.entities[str(ent)] for ent in doc.ents if str(ent) in self.entities        ]        # Return combined information about entities to put into context.        return {self.memory_key: \"\\n\".join(entities)}    def save_context(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any], outputs: Dict[str, str]) -> None:        \"\"\"Save context from this conversation to buffer.\"\"\"        # Get the input text and run through spacy        text = inputs[list(inputs.keys())[0]]        doc = nlp(text)        # For each entity that was mentioned, save this information to the dictionary.        for ent in doc.ents:            ent_str = str(ent)            if ent_str in self.entities:                self.entities[ent_str] += f\"\\n{text}\"            else:                self.entities[ent_str] = textWe now define a prompt that takes in information about entities as well as user inputfrom langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplatetemplate = \"\"\"The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI.

Tonight, I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.         One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.         And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.Basic Example (including saving to disk)\u200bExtending the previous example, if you want to save to disk, simply initialize the Chroma client and pass the directory where you want the data to be saved to. Caution: Chroma makes a best-effort to automatically save data to disk, however multiple in-memory clients can stomp each other's work. As a best practice, only have one client per path running at any given time.# save to diskdb2 = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, persist_directory=\"./chroma_db\")docs = db2.similarity_search(query)# load from diskdb3 = Chroma(persist_directory=\"./chroma_db\", embedding_function=embedding_function)docs = db3.similarity_search(query)print(docs[0].page_content)    Tonight.

One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.Passing a Chroma Client into Langchain\u200bYou can also create a Chroma Client and pass it to LangChain. This is particularly useful if you want easier access to the underlying database.You can also specify the collection name that you want LangChain to use.import chromadbpersistent_client = chromadb.PersistentClient()collection = persistent_client.get_or_create_collection(\"collection_name\")collection.add(ids=[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"], documents=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])langchain_chroma = Chroma(    client=persistent_client,    collection_name=\"collection_name\",    embedding_function=embedding_function,)print(\"There are\", langchain_chroma._collection.count(), \"in the collection\")    Add of existing embedding ID: 1    Add of existing embedding ID: 2    Add of existing embedding ID: 3    Add of existing embedding ID: 1    Add of existing embedding ID: 2    Add of existing embedding ID: 3    Add of existing embedding ID: 1    Insert of existing embedding ID: 1    Add of existing embedding ID: 2    Insert of existing embedding ID: 2    Add of existing embedding ID: 3    Insert of existing embedding ID: 3    There are 3 in the collectionBasic Example (using the Docker Container)\u200bYou can also run the Chroma Server in a Docker container separately, create a Client to connect to it, and then pass that to LangChain. Chroma has the ability to handle multiple Collections of documents, but the LangChain interface expects one, so we need to specify the collection name. The default collection name used by LangChain is \"langchain\".Here is how to clone, build, and run the Docker Image:git clone git@github.com:chroma-core/chroma.gitdocker-compose up -d --build# create the chroma clientimport chromadbimport uuidfrom chromadb.config import Settingsclient = chromadb.HttpClient(settings=Settings(allow_reset=True))client.reset()  # resets the databasecollection = client.create_collection(\"my_collection\")for doc in docs:    collection.add(        ids=[str(uuid.uuid1())], metadatas=doc.metadata, documents=doc.page_content    )# tell LangChain to use our client and collection namedb4 = Chroma(client=client, collection_name=\"my_collection\")docs = db.similarity_search(query)print(docs[0].page_content)    Tonight.

One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.Update and Delete\u200bWhile building toward a real application, you want to go beyond adding data, and also update and delete data. Chroma has users provide ids to simplify the bookkeeping here. ids can be the name of the file, or a combined has like filename_paragraphNumber, etc.Chroma supports all these operations - though some of them are still being integrated all the way through the LangChain interface. Additional workflow improvements will be added soon.Here is a basic example showing how to do various operations:# create simple idsids = [str(i) for i in range(1, len(docs) + 1)]# add dataexample_db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, ids=ids)docs = example_db.similarity_search(query)print(docs[0].metadata)# update the metadata for a documentdocs[0].metadata = {    \"source\": \"../../../state_of_the_union.txt\",    \"new_value\": \"hello world\",}example_db.update_document(ids[0], docs[0])print(example_db._collection.get(ids=[ids[0]]))# delete the last documentprint(\"count before\", example_db._collection.count())example_db._collection.delete(ids=[ids[-1]])print(\"count after\", example_db._collection.count())    {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'}    {'ids': ['1'], 'embeddings': None, 'metadatas': [{'new_value': 'hello world', 'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'}], 'documents': ['Tonight.

This type of memory creates a summary of the conversation over time. This can be useful for condensing information from the conversation over time.\nConversation summary memory summarizes the conversation as it happens and stores the current summary in memory. This memory can then be used to inject the summary of the conversation so far into a prompt/chain. This memory is most useful for longer conversations, where keeping the past message history in the prompt verbatim would take up too many tokens.Let's first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory.from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory, ChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain.llms import OpenAImemory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))memory.save_context({\"input\": \"hi\"}, {\"output\": \"whats up\"})memory.load_memory_variables({})    {'history': '\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.'}We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), return_messages=True)memory.save_context({\"input\": \"hi\"}, {\"output\": \"whats up\"})memory.load_memory_variables({})    {'history': [SystemMessage(content='\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.', additional_kwargs={})]}We can also utilize the predict_new_summary method directly.messages = memory.chat_memory.messagesprevious_summary = \"\"memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary)    '\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.'Initializing with messages\u200bIf you have messages outside this class, you can easily initialize the class with ChatMessageHistory.

In this next example, we will experiment with more complex chains that involve multiple inputs, and where there also multiple final outputs. Of particular importance is how we name the input/output variable names. In the above example we didn't have to think about that because we were just passing the output of one chain directly as input to the next, but here we do have worry about that because we have multiple inputs.# This is an LLMChain to write a synopsis given a title of a play and the era it is set in.llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)template = \"\"\"You are a playwright.

Using SimpleMemory is a convenient way to do manage this and clean up your chains.For example, using the previous playwright SequentialChain, lets say you wanted to include some context about date, time and location of the play, and using the generated synopsis and review, create some social media post text.

This is done by first fetching more results than k and then filtering them. You can filter the documents based on metadata. You can also set the fetch_k parameter when calling any search method to set how many documents you want to fetch before filtering. Here is a small example:from langchain.schema import Documentlist_of_documents = [    Document(page_content=\"foo\", metadata=dict(page=1)),    Document(page_content=\"bar\", metadata=dict(page=1)),    Document(page_content=\"foo\", metadata=dict(page=2)),    Document(page_content=\"barbar\", metadata=dict(page=2)),    Document(page_content=\"foo\", metadata=dict(page=3)),    Document(page_content=\"bar burr\", metadata=dict(page=3)),    Document(page_content=\"foo\", metadata=dict(page=4)),    Document(page_content=\"bar bruh\", metadata=dict(page=4)),]db = FAISS.from_documents(list_of_documents, embeddings)results_with_scores = db.similarity_search_with_score(\"foo\")for doc, score in results_with_scores:    print(f\"Content: {doc.page_content}, Metadata: {doc.metadata}, Score: {score}\")    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 1}, Score: 5.159960813797904e-15    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 2}, Score: 5.159960813797904e-15    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 3}, Score: 5.159960813797904e-15    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 4}, Score: 5.159960813797904e-15Now we make the same query call but we filter for only page = 1 results_with_scores = db.similarity_search_with_score(\"foo\", filter=dict(page=1))for doc, score in results_with_scores:    print(f\"Content: {doc.page_content}, Metadata: {doc.metadata}, Score: {score}\")    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 1}, Score: 5.159960813797904e-15    Content: bar, Metadata: {'page': 1}, Score: 0.3131446838378906Same thing can be done with the max_marginal_relevance_search as well.results = db.max_marginal_relevance_search(\"foo\", filter=dict(page=1))for doc in results:    print(f\"Content: {doc.page_content}, Metadata: {doc.metadata}\")    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 1}    Content: bar, Metadata: {'page': 1}Here is an example of how to set fetch_k parameter when calling similarity_search. Usually you would want the fetch_k parameter >> k parameter. This is because the fetch_k parameter is the number of documents that will be fetched before filtering. If you set fetch_k to a low number, you might not get enough documents to filter from.results = db.similarity_search(\"foo\", filter=dict(page=1), k=1, fetch_k=4)for doc in results:    print(f\"Content: {doc.page_content}, Metadata: {doc.metadata}\")    Content: foo, Metadata: {'page': 1}",

        "page_content": "Partial prompt templatesLike other methods, it can make sense to \"partial\" a prompt template - eg pass in a subset of the required values, as to create a new prompt template which expects only the remaining subset of values.LangChain supports this in two ways:Partial formatting with string values.Partial formatting with functions that return string values.These two different ways support different use cases. In the examples below, we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain.Partial With Strings\u200bOne common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, foo and baz. If you get the foo value early on in the chain, but the baz value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the foo value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this:from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplateprompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"{foo}{bar}\", input_variables=[\"foo\", \"bar\"])partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo=\"foo\");print(partial_prompt.format(bar=\"baz\"))    foobazYou can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables.prompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"{foo}{bar}\", input_variables=[\"bar\"], partial_variables={\"foo\": \"foo\"})print(prompt.format(bar=\"baz\"))    foobazPartial With Functions\u200bThe other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case, it's very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date.from datetime import datetimedef _get_datetime():    now = datetime.now()    return now.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S\")prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}\",     input_variables=[\"adjective\", \"date\"]);partial_prompt = prompt.partial(date=_get_datetime)print(partial_prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\"))    Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables, which often makes more sense in this workflow.prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}\",     input_variables=[\"adjective\"],    partial_variables={\"date\": _get_datetime});print(prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\"))    Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16",

Built on top of an open-source package called whylogs, the platform enables Data Scientists and Engineers to:Set up in minutes: Begin generating statistical profiles of any dataset using whylogs, the lightweight open-source library.Upload dataset profiles to the WhyLabs platform for centralized and customizable monitoring/alerting of dataset features as well as model inputs, outputs, and performance.Integrate seamlessly: interoperable with any data pipeline, ML infrastructure, or framework. Generate real-time insights into your existing data flow. See more about our integrations here.Scale to terabytes: handle your large-scale data, keeping compute requirements low. Integrate with either batch or streaming data pipelines.Maintain data privacy: WhyLabs relies statistical profiles created via whylogs so your actual data never leaves your environment!\nEnable observability to detect inputs and LLM issues faster, deliver continuous improvements, and avoid costly incidents.Installation and Setup\u200b%pip install langkit openai langchainMake sure to set the required API keys and config required to send telemetry to WhyLabs:WhyLabs API Key: https://whylabs.ai/whylabs-free-sign-upOrg and Dataset https://docs.whylabs.ai/docs/whylabs-onboardingOpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keysThen you can set them like this:import osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"os.environ[\"WHYLABS_DEFAULT_ORG_ID\"] = \"\"os.environ[\"WHYLABS_DEFAULT_DATASET_ID\"] = \"\"os.environ[\"WHYLABS_API_KEY\"] = \"\"Note: the callback supports directly passing in these variables to the callback, when no auth is directly passed in it will default to the environment.

To achieve this task, we will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function.Why are custom prompt templates needed?\u200bLangChain provides a set of default prompt templates that can be used to generate prompts for a variety of tasks. However, there may be cases where the default prompt templates do not meet your needs. For example, you may want to create a prompt template with specific dynamic instructions for your language model. In such cases, you can create a custom prompt template.Take a look at the current set of default prompt templates here.Creating a Custom Prompt Template\u200bThere are essentially two distinct prompt templates available - string prompt templates and chat prompt templates. String prompt templates provides a simple prompt in string format, while chat prompt templates produces a more structured prompt to be used with a chat API.In this guide, we will create a custom prompt using a string prompt template. To create a custom string prompt template, there are two requirements:It has an input_variables attribute that exposes what input variables the prompt template expects.It exposes a format method that takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the expected input_variables and returns the formatted prompt.We will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input and formats the prompt to provide the source code of the function. To achieve this, let's first create a function that will return the source code of a function given its name.import inspectdef get_source_code(function_name):    # Get the source code of the function    return inspect.getsource(function_name)Next, we'll create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function.from langchain.prompts import StringPromptTemplatefrom pydantic import BaseModel, validatorPROMPT = \"\"\"\\Given the function name and source code, generate an English language explanation of the function.Function Name: {function_name}Source Code:{source_code}Explanation:\"\"\"class FunctionExplainerPromptTemplate(StringPromptTemplate, BaseModel):    \"\"\"A custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function.\"\"\"    @validator(\"input_variables\")    def validate_input_variables(cls, v):        \"\"\"Validate that the input variables are correct.\"\"\"        if len(v) != 1 or \"function_name\" not in v:            raise ValueError(\"function_name must be the only input_variable.\")        return v    def format(self, **kwargs) -> str:        # Get the source code of the function        source_code = get_source_code(kwargs[\"function_name\"])        # Generate the prompt to be sent to the language model        prompt = PROMPT.format(            function_name=kwargs[\"function_name\"].__name__, source_code=source_code        )        return prompt    def _prompt_type(self):        return \"function-explainer\"Use the custom prompt template\u200bNow that we have created a custom prompt template, we can use it to generate prompts for our task.fn_explainer = FunctionExplainerPromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"function_name\"])# Generate a prompt for the function \"get_source_code\"prompt = fn_explainer.format(function_name=get_source_code)print(prompt)    Given the function name and source code, generate an English language explanation of the function.

The DataForSeo API allows users to retrieve SERP from most popular search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo. It also allows to get SERPs from different search engine types like Maps, News, Events, etc.from langchain.utilities import DataForSeoAPIWrapperSetting up the API wrapper with your credentials\u200bYou can obtain your API credentials by registering on the DataForSeo website.import osos.environ[\"DATAFORSEO_LOGIN\"] = \"your_api_access_username\"os.environ[\"DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD\"] = \"your_api_access_password\"wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper()The run method will return the first result snippet from one of the following elements: answer_box, knowledge_graph, featured_snippet, shopping, organic.wrapper.run(\"Weather in Los Angeles\")The Difference Between run and results\u200brun and results are two methods provided by the DataForSeoAPIWrapper class.The run method executes the search and returns the first result snippet from the answer box, knowledge graph, featured snippet, shopping, or organic results. These elements are sorted by priority from highest to lowest.The results method returns a JSON response configured according to the parameters set in the wrapper. This allows for more flexibility in terms of what data you want to return from the API.Getting Results as JSON\u200bYou can customize the result types and fields you want to return in the JSON response. You can also set a maximum count for the number of top results to return.json_wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(    json_result_types=[\"organic\", \"knowledge_graph\", \"answer_box\"],    json_result_fields=[\"type\", \"title\", \"description\", \"text\"],    top_count=3,)json_wrapper.results(\"Bill Gates\")Customizing Location and Language\u200bYou can specify the location and language of your search results by passing additional parameters to the API wrapper.customized_wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(    top_count=10,    json_result_types=[\"organic\", \"local_pack\"],    json_result_fields=[\"title\", \"description\", \"type\"],    params={\"location_name\": \"Germany\", \"language_code\": \"en\"},)customized_wrapper.results(\"coffee near me\")Customizing the Search Engine\u200bYou can also specify the search engine you want to use.customized_wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(    top_count=10,    json_result_types=[\"organic\", \"local_pack\"],    json_result_fields=[\"title\", \"description\", \"type\"],    params={\"location_name\": \"Germany\", \"language_code\": \"en\", \"se_name\": \"bing\"},)customized_wrapper.results(\"coffee near me\")Customizing the Search Type\u200bThe API wrapper also allows you to specify the type of search you want to perform. For example, you can perform a maps search.maps_search = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(    top_count=10,    json_result_fields=[\"title\", \"value\", \"address\", \"rating\", \"type\"],    params={        \"location_coordinate\": \"52.512,13.36,12z\",        \"language_code\": \"en\",        \"se_type\": \"maps\",    },)maps_search.results(\"coffee near me\")Integration with Langchain Agents\u200bYou can use the Tool class from the langchain.agents module to integrate the DataForSeoAPIWrapper with a langchain agent.

Some API providers, like OpenAI, specifically prohibit you, or your end users, from generating some types of harmful content.

        "page_content": "Document transformersinfoHead to Integrations for documentation on built-in document transformer integrations with 3rd-party tools.Once you've loaded documents, you'll often want to transform them to better suit your application. The simplest example\nis you may want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain\nhas a number of built-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.Text splitters\u200bWhen you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks.\nAs simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What \"semantically related\" means could depend on the type of text.\nThis notebook showcases several ways to do that.At a high level, text splitters work as following:Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).That means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text splitter:How the text is splitHow the chunk size is measuredGet started with text splitters\u200bThe default recommended text splitter is the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. This text splitter takes a list of characters. It tries to create chunks based on splitting on the first character, but if any chunks are too large it then moves onto the next character, and so forth. By default the characters it tries to split on are [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]In addition to controlling which characters you can split on, you can also control a few other things:length_function: how the length of chunks is calculated. Defaults to just counting number of characters, but it's pretty common to pass a token counter here.chunk_size: the maximum size of your chunks (as measured by the length function).chunk_overlap: the maximum overlap between chunks. It can be nice to have some overlap to maintain some continuity between chunks (eg do a sliding window).add_start_index: whether to include the starting position of each chunk within the original document in the metadata.# This is a long document we can split up.with open('../../state_of_the_union.txt') as f:    state_of_the_union = f.read()from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplittertext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(    # Set a really small chunk size, just to show.    chunk_size = 100,    chunk_overlap  = 20,    length_function = len,    add_start_index = True,)texts = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])print(texts[0])print(texts[1])    page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman.

My fellow Americans.' metadata={'start_index': 82}Other transformations:\u200bFilter redundant docs, translate docs, extract metadata, and more\u200bWe can do perform a number of transformations on docs which are not simply splitting the text. With the\nEmbeddingsRedundantFilter we can identify similar documents and filter out redundancies. With integrations like\ndoctran we can do things like translate documents from one language\nto another, extract desired properties and add them to metadata, and convert conversational dialogue into a Q/A format\nset of documents.",

We'll see it's a viable approach to start working with a massive API spec AND to assist with user queries that require multiple steps against the API.The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a \"planner\" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a \"controller\" will be responsible for how to call them.In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context. The controller is an LLM agent that is instantiated with documentation for only the endpoints for a particular plan.

This helps us make sure that the model outputs exactly the schema of entities and properties that we want, with their appropriate types.The extraction chain is to be used when we want to extract several entities with their properties from the same passage (i.e. what people were mentioned in this passage?)from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain, create_extraction_chain_pydanticfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate    /Users/harrisonchase/.pyenv/versions/3.9.1/envs/langchain/lib/python3.9/site-packages/deeplake/util/check_latest_version.py:32: UserWarning: A newer version of deeplake (3.6.4) is available. It's recommended that you update to the latest version using `pip install -U deeplake`.      warnings.warn(llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\")Extracting entities\u200bTo extract entities, we need to create a schema where we specify all the properties we want to find and the type we expect them to have. We can also specify which of these properties are required and which are optional.schema = {    \"properties\": {        \"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"height\": {\"type\": \"integer\"},        \"hair_color\": {\"type\": \"string\"},    },    \"required\": [\"name\", \"height\"],}inp = \"\"\"Alex is 5 feet tall. Claudia is 1 feet taller Alex and jumps higher than him. Claudia is a brunette and Alex is blonde.        \"\"\"chain = create_extraction_chain(schema, llm)As we can see, we extracted the required entities and their properties in the required format (it even calculated Claudia's height before returning!)chain.run(inp)    [{'name': 'Alex', 'height': 5, 'hair_color': 'blonde'},     {'name': 'Claudia', 'height': 6, 'hair_color': 'brunette'}]Several entity types\u200bNotice that we are using OpenAI functions under the hood and thus the model can only call one function per request (with one, unique schema)If we want to extract more than one entity type, we need to introduce a little hack - we will define our properties with an included entity type. Following we have an example where we also want to extract dog attributes from the passage. Notice the 'person' and 'dog' prefixes we use for each property; this tells the model which entity type the property refers to. In this way, the model can return properties from several entity types in one single call.schema = {    \"properties\": {        \"person_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"person_height\": {\"type\": \"integer\"},        \"person_hair_color\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_breed\": {\"type\": \"string\"},    },    \"required\": [\"person_name\", \"person_height\"],}inp = \"\"\"Alex is 5 feet tall. Claudia is 1 feet taller Alex and jumps higher than him. Claudia is a brunette and Alex is blonde.Alex's dog Frosty is a labrador and likes to play hide and seek.        \"\"\"chain = create_extraction_chain(schema, llm)People attributes and dog attributes were correctly extracted from the text in the same callchain.run(inp)    [{'person_name': 'Alex',      'person_height': 5,      'person_hair_color': 'blonde',      'dog_name': 'Frosty',      'dog_breed': 'labrador'},     {'person_name': 'Claudia',      'person_height': 6,      'person_hair_color': 'brunette'}]Unrelated entities\u200bWhat if our entities are unrelated? In that case, the model will return the unrelated entities in different dictionaries, allowing us to successfully extract several unrelated entity types in the same call.Notice that we use required: []: we need to allow the model to return only person attributes or only dog attributes for a single entity (person or dog)schema = {    \"properties\": {        \"person_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"person_height\": {\"type\": \"integer\"},        \"person_hair_color\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_breed\": {\"type\": \"string\"},    },    \"required\": [],}inp = \"\"\"Alex is 5 feet tall. Claudia is 1 feet taller Alex and jumps higher than him. Claudia is a brunette and Alex is blonde.Willow is a German Shepherd that likes to play with other dogs and can always be found playing with Milo, a border collie that lives close by.\"\"\"chain = create_extraction_chain(schema, llm)We have each entity in its own separate dictionary, with only the appropriate attributes being returnedchain.run(inp)    [{'person_name': 'Alex', 'person_height': 5, 'person_hair_color': 'blonde'},     {'person_name': 'Claudia',      'person_height': 6,      'person_hair_color': 'brunette'},     {'dog_name': 'Willow', 'dog_breed': 'German Shepherd'},     {'dog_name': 'Milo', 'dog_breed': 'border collie'}]Extra info for an entity\u200bWhat if.. we don't know what we want? More specifically, say we know a few properties we want to extract for a given entity but we also want to know if there's any extra information in the passage. Fortunately, we don't need to structure everything - we can have unstructured extraction as well. We can do this by introducing another hack, namely the extra_info attribute - let's see an example.schema = {    \"properties\": {        \"person_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"person_height\": {\"type\": \"integer\"},        \"person_hair_color\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_breed\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"dog_extra_info\": {\"type\": \"string\"},    },}inp = \"\"\"Alex is 5 feet tall. Claudia is 1 feet taller Alex and jumps higher than him. Claudia is a brunette and Alex is blonde.Willow is a German Shepherd that likes to play with other dogs and can always be found playing with Milo, a border collie that lives close by.\"\"\"chain = create_extraction_chain(schema, llm)It is nice to know more about Willow and Milo!chain.run(inp)    [{'person_name': 'Alex', 'person_height': 5, 'person_hair_color': 'blonde'},     {'person_name': 'Claudia',      'person_height': 6,      'person_hair_color': 'brunette'},     {'dog_name': 'Willow',      'dog_breed': 'German Shepherd',      'dog_extra_information': 'likes to play with other dogs'},     {'dog_name': 'Milo',      'dog_breed': 'border collie',      'dog_extra_information': 'lives close by'}]Pydantic example\u200bWe can also use a Pydantic schema to choose the required properties and types and we will set as 'Optional' those that are not strictly required.By using the create_extraction_chain_pydantic function, we can send a Pydantic schema as input and the output will be an instantiated object that respects our desired schema. In this way, we can specify our schema in the same manner that we would a new class or function in Python - with purely Pythonic types.from typing import Optional, Listfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Fieldclass Properties(BaseModel):    person_name: str    person_height: int    person_hair_color: str    dog_breed: Optional[str]    dog_name: Optional[str]chain = create_extraction_chain_pydantic(pydantic_schema=Properties, llm=llm)inp = \"\"\"Alex is 5 feet tall.

        "page_content": "SerializationIt is often preferrable to store prompts not as python code but as files. This can make it easy to share, store, and version prompts. This notebook covers how to do that in LangChain, walking through all the different types of prompts and the different serialization options.At a high level, the following design principles are applied to serialization:Both JSON and YAML are supported. We want to support serialization methods that are human readable on disk, and YAML and JSON are two of the most popular methods for that. Note that this rule applies to prompts. For other assets, like Examples, different serialization methods may be supported.We support specifying everything in one file, or storing different components (templates, examples, etc) in different files and referencing them. For some cases, storing everything in file makes the most sense, but for others it is preferrable to split up some of the assets (long templates, large examples, reusable components). LangChain supports both.There is also a single entry point to load prompts from disk, making it easy to load any type of prompt.# All prompts are loaded through the `load_prompt` function.from langchain.prompts import load_promptPromptTemplate\u200bThis section covers examples for loading a PromptTemplate.Loading from YAML\u200bThis shows an example of loading a PromptTemplate from YAML.cat simple_prompt.yaml    _type: prompt    input_variables:        [\"adjective\", \"content\"]    template:         Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.prompt = load_prompt(\"simple_prompt.yaml\")print(prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\"))    Tell me a funny joke about chickens.Loading from JSON\u200bThis shows an example of loading a PromptTemplate from JSON.cat simple_prompt.json    {        \"_type\": \"prompt\",        \"input_variables\": [\"adjective\", \"content\"],        \"template\": \"Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.\"    }prompt = load_prompt(\"simple_prompt.json\")print(prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\"))Tell me a funny joke about chickens.Loading Template from a File\u200bThis shows an example of storing the template in a separate file and then referencing it in the config.

Further, by using PaLM API on Vertex AI, you agree to the Generative AI Preview terms and conditions (Preview Terms).For PaLM API on Vertex AI, you can process personal data as outlined in the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, subject to applicable restrictions and obligations in the Agreement (as defined in the Preview Terms).To use Vertex AI PaLM you must have the google-cloud-aiplatform Python package installed and either:Have credentials configured for your environment (gcloud, workload identity, etc...)Store the path to a service account JSON file as the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variableThis codebase uses the google.auth library which first looks for the application credentials variable mentioned above, and then looks for system-level auth.For more information, see: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAChttps://googleapis.dev/python/google-auth/latest/reference/google.auth.html#module-google.auth#!pip install google-cloud-aiplatformfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatVertexAIfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (    ChatPromptTemplate,    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessagechat = ChatVertexAI()messages = [    SystemMessage(        content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"    ),    HumanMessage(        content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French.

You can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate's format_prompt -- this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like:template = (    \"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\")system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)human_template = \"{text}\"human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])# get a chat completion from the formatted messageschat(    chat_prompt.format_prompt(        input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\"    ).to_messages())    AIMessage(content='Sure, here is the translation of \"I love programming\" in French:\\n\\nJ\\'aime programmer.', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)You can now leverage the Codey API for code chat within Vertex AI.

Each request log contains timestamp, model name, total cost, request time, request json, response json, and additional Portkey features.Tracing: Trace id can be passed along with each request and is visibe on the logs on Portkey dashboard. You can also set a distinct trace id for each request. You can append user feedback to a trace id as well.Caching: Respond to previously served customers queries from cache instead of sending them again to OpenAI. Match exact strings OR semantically similar strings. Cache can save costs and reduce latencies by 20x.Retries: Automatically reprocess any unsuccessful API requests upto 5 times. Uses an exponential backoff strategy, which spaces out retry attempts to prevent network overload.Tagging: Track and audit each user interaction in high detail with predefined tags.FeatureConfig KeyValue (Type)Required/OptionalAPI Keyapi_keyAPI Key (string)\u2705 RequiredTracing Requeststrace_idCustom string\u2754 OptionalAutomatic Retriesretry_countinteger [1,2,3,4,5]\u2754 OptionalEnabling Cachecachesimple OR semantic\u2754 OptionalCache Force Refreshcache_force_refreshTrue\u2754 OptionalSet Cache Expirycache_ageinteger (in seconds)\u2754 OptionalAdd Useruserstring\u2754 OptionalAdd Organisationorganisationstring\u2754 OptionalAdd Environmentenvironmentstring\u2754 OptionalAdd Prompt (version/id/string)promptstring\u2754 OptionalEnabling all Portkey Features:\u200bheaders = Portkey.Config(        # Mandatory    api_key=\"<PORTKEY_API_KEY>\",          # Cache Options    cache=\"semantic\",                     cache_force_refresh=\"True\",                 cache_age=1729,      # Advanced    retry_count=5,                                               trace_id=\"langchain_agent\",                              # Metadata    environment=\"production\",            user=\"john\",                          organisation=\"acme\",                 prompt=\"Frost\"    )For detailed information on each feature and how to use it, please refer to the Portkey docs.

Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d \u03a3 and let \u03c0 \u2236 P ( E ) \u2192 P d \u03a3 be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 \u2295 \u22ef \u2295 L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s \u2212 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan \u03a3. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d \u03a3 is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\\n\\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut o\ufb00 by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut o\ufb00 by F = y 1 f 1 + \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\\n\\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s \u2212 1 \u03a3 ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d \u03a3 .\\n\\nThe following is a key remark.\\n\\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism \u03b9 \u2236 X \u2192 Y \u2282 P d + s \u2212 1 \u03a3 ,X . Moreover every point z \u2236 = ( x, y ) \u2208 Y with y \u2260 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) \u2282 X \u2282 P d \u03a3 there exists W \u2032 \u2282 Y \u2282 P d + s \u2212 1 \u03a3 ,X such that \u03c0 ( W \u2032 ) = W , i.e., W \u2032 = { z = ( x, y ) \u2223 x \u2208 W } .\\n\\nFor X \u2282 P d \u03a3 a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i \u2217 \u2236 H d \u2212 s ( P d \u03a3 , C ) \u2192 H d \u2212 s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\\n\\nDe\ufb01nition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d \u2212 s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d \u2212 s ( X, C )/ i \u2217 ( H d \u2212 s ( P d \u03a3 , C )) and H d \u2212 s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coe\ufb03cients.\\n\\nH d \u2212 s ( P d \u03a3 , C ) and H d \u2212 s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i \u2217 is com- patible with them, so that H d \u2212 s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.\\n\\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\\n\\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 \u2229\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5\u2229 X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d \u03a3 cut o\ufb00 by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p \u2260 d + s \u2212 1 2 , d + s \u2212 3 2\\n\\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coe\ufb03cients since H \u25cf ( X, C ) = H \u25cf ( X, Q ) \u2297 Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\\n\\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + \u22ef + y k f k = 0 } \u2282 P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 \u2229 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u2229 X f k \u2282 P k + 2 \u03a3 . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) \u2260 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) \u2243 H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\\n\\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis \u03bb C 1 , . . . , \u03bb C n with rational coe\ufb03cients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n \u2236 = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar\u00b4e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to \u03bb C i , [ C i ] \u21a6 \u03bb C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if \u03b1 \u2208 Cl ( P k + 2 \u03a3 ) then ( \u03b1, 0 ) \u2208 Cl ( P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X ) . So the polynomials de\ufb01ning C i \u2282 P k + 2 \u03a3 can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, \u03a3 but with di\ufb00erent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + \u22ef + y k f k = 0 } and\\n\\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\\n\\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that \u03bb C i is di\ufb00erent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { \u03bb C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C \u2282 P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X such that \u03bb C \u2208 H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X , Q ) with i \u2217 ( \u03bb C ) = \u03bb C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V \u2282 P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X such that V \u2229 Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X ,i.e., [ V \u2229 Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that \u03c0 ( V ) \u2229 X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 \u03a3 where \u03c0 \u2236 ( x, y ) \u21a6 x . Hence [ \u03c0 ( V ) \u2229 X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that \u03bb C j comes from P k + 2 \u03a3 which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\\n\\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\\n\\nargument we have:\\n\\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +\u22ef+ y s f s = 0 } \u2282 P 2 k + 1 \u03a3 ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 \u2229 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u2229 X f s \u2282 P d \u03a3 such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\\n\\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s \u2212 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\\n\\nProof.

Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uni\ufb01ed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained.

First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are \"concise\".from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluatorevaluator = load_evaluator(\"criteria\", criteria=\"conciseness\")# This is equivalent to loading using the enumfrom langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorTypeevaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=\"conciseness\")eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings(    prediction=\"What's 2+2?

        "page_content": "OpenAI Functions Metadata TaggerIt can often be useful to tag ingested documents with structured metadata, such as the title, tone, or length of a document, to allow for more targeted similarity search later. However, for large numbers of documents, performing this labelling process manually can be tedious.The OpenAIMetadataTagger document transformer automates this process by extracting metadata from each provided document according to a provided schema. It uses a configurable OpenAI Functions-powered chain under the hood, so if you pass a custom LLM instance, it must be an OpenAI model with functions support. Note: This document transformer works best with complete documents, so it's best to run it first with whole documents before doing any other splitting or processing!For example, let's say you wanted to index a set of movie reviews. You could initialize the document transformer with a valid JSON Schema object as follows:from langchain.schema import Documentfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.document_transformers.openai_functions import create_metadata_taggerschema = {    \"properties\": {        \"movie_title\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"critic\": {\"type\": \"string\"},        \"tone\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"positive\", \"negative\"]},        \"rating\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"The number of stars the critic rated the movie\",        },    },    \"required\": [\"movie_title\", \"critic\", \"tone\"],}# Must be an OpenAI model that supports functionsllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\")document_transformer = create_metadata_tagger(metadata_schema=schema, llm=llm)You can then simply pass the document transformer a list of documents, and it will extract metadata from the contents:original_documents = [    Document(        page_content=\"Review of The Bee Movie\\nBy Roger Ebert\\n\\nThis is the greatest movie ever made. 4 out of 5 stars.\"    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Review of The Godfather\\nBy Anonymous\\n\\nThis movie was super boring. 1 out of 5 stars.\",        metadata={\"reliable\": False},    ),]enhanced_documents = document_transformer.transform_documents(original_documents)import jsonprint(    *[d.page_content + \"\\n\\n\" + json.dumps(d.metadata) for d in enhanced_documents],    sep=\"\\n\\n---------------\\n\\n\")    Review of The Bee Movie    By Roger Ebert        This is the greatest movie ever made. 4 out of 5 stars.        {\"movie_title\": \"The Bee Movie\", \"critic\": \"Roger Ebert\", \"tone\": \"positive\", \"rating\": 4}        ---------------        Review of The Godfather    By Anonymous        This movie was super boring. 1 out of 5 stars.        {\"movie_title\": \"The Godfather\", \"critic\": \"Anonymous\", \"tone\": \"negative\", \"rating\": 1, \"reliable\": false}The new documents can then be further processed by a text splitter before being loaded into a vector store. Extracted fields will not overwrite existing metadata.You can also initialize the document transformer with a Pydantic schema:from typing import Literalfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Fieldclass Properties(BaseModel):    movie_title: str    critic: str    tone: Literal[\"positive\", \"negative\"]    rating: int = Field(description=\"Rating out of 5 stars\")document_transformer = create_metadata_tagger(Properties, llm)enhanced_documents = document_transformer.transform_documents(original_documents)print(    *[d.page_content + \"\\n\\n\" + json.dumps(d.metadata) for d in enhanced_documents],    sep=\"\\n\\n---------------\\n\\n\")    Review of The Bee Movie    By Roger Ebert        This is the greatest movie ever made. 4 out of 5 stars.        {\"movie_title\": \"The Bee Movie\", \"critic\": \"Roger Ebert\", \"tone\": \"positive\", \"rating\": 4}        ---------------        Review of The Godfather    By Anonymous        This movie was super boring. 1 out of 5 stars.        {\"movie_title\": \"The Godfather\", \"critic\": \"Anonymous\", \"tone\": \"negative\", \"rating\": 1, \"reliable\": false}Customization\u200bYou can pass the underlying tagging chain the standard LLMChain arguments in the document transformer constructor. For example, if you wanted to ask the LLM to focus specific details in the input documents, or extract metadata in a certain style, you could pass in a custom prompt:from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplateprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(    \"\"\"Extract relevant information from the following text.Anonymous critics are actually Roger Ebert.{input}\"\"\")document_transformer = create_metadata_tagger(schema, llm, prompt=prompt)enhanced_documents = document_transformer.transform_documents(original_documents)print(    *[d.page_content + \"\\n\\n\" + json.dumps(d.metadata) for d in enhanced_documents],    sep=\"\\n\\n---------------\\n\\n\")    Review of The Bee Movie    By Roger Ebert        This is the greatest movie ever made. 4 out of 5 stars.        {\"movie_title\": \"The Bee Movie\", \"critic\": \"Roger Ebert\", \"tone\": \"positive\", \"rating\": 4}        ---------------        Review of The Godfather    By Anonymous        This movie was super boring. 1 out of 5 stars.        {\"movie_title\": \"The Godfather\", \"critic\": \"Roger Ebert\", \"tone\": \"negative\", \"rating\": 1, \"reliable\": false}",

Create sample data\u200bYou can generate a sample group chat conversation using ChatGPT with this prompt:Generate a group chat conversation with three friends talking about their day, referencing real places and fictional names. Make it funny and as detailed as possible.I've already generated such a chat in messages.txt. We can keep it simple and use this for our example.3. Ingest chat embeddings\u200bWe load the messages in the text file, chunk and upload to ActiveLoop Vector store.with open(\"messages.txt\") as f:    state_of_the_union = f.read()text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)pages = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)texts = text_splitter.create_documents(pages)print(texts)dataset_path = \"hub://\" + org + \"/data\"embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()db = DeepLake.from_documents(    texts, embeddings, dataset_path=dataset_path, overwrite=True)Optional: You can also use Deep Lake's Managed Tensor Database as a hosting service and run queries there. In order to do so, it is necessary to specify the runtime parameter as {'tensor_db': True} during the creation of the vector store. This configuration enables the execution of queries on the Managed Tensor Database, rather than on the client side. It should be noted that this functionality is not applicable to datasets stored locally or in-memory. In the event that a vector store has already been created outside of the Managed Tensor Database, it is possible to transfer it to the Managed Tensor Database by following the prescribed steps.# with open(\"messages.txt\") as f:#     state_of_the_union = f.read()# text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)# pages = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)# text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)# texts = text_splitter.create_documents(pages)# print(texts)# dataset_path = \"hub://\" + org + \"/data\"# embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()# db = DeepLake.from_documents(#     texts, embeddings, dataset_path=dataset_path, overwrite=True, runtime=\"tensor_db\"# )4.

        "page_content": "SQLThis example demonstrates the use of the SQLDatabaseChain for answering questions over a SQL database.Under the hood, LangChain uses SQLAlchemy to connect to SQL databases. The SQLDatabaseChain can therefore be used with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy, such as MS SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks and SQLite. Please refer to the SQLAlchemy documentation for more information about requirements for connecting to your database. For example, a connection to MySQL requires an appropriate connector such as PyMySQL. A URI for a MySQL connection might look like: mysql+pymysql://user:pass@some_mysql_db_address/db_name.This demonstration uses SQLite and the example Chinook database.\nTo set it up, follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.from langchain import OpenAI, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChaindb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\")llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True)NOTE: For data-sensitive projects, you can specify return_direct=True in the SQLDatabaseChain initialization to directly return the output of the SQL query without any additional formatting. This prevents the LLM from seeing any contents within the database. Note, however, the LLM still has access to the database scheme (i.e. dialect, table and key names) by default.db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)db_chain.run(\"How many employees are there?\")            > Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...    How many employees are there?    SQLQuery:    /workspace/langchain/langchain/sql_database.py:191: SAWarning: Dialect sqlite+pysqlite does *not* support Decimal objects natively, and SQLAlchemy must convert from floating point - rounding errors and other issues may occur. Please consider storing Decimal numbers as strings or integers on this platform for lossless storage.      sample_rows = connection.execute(command)    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Employee\";    SQLResult: [(8,)]    Answer:There are 8 employees.    > Finished chain.    'There are 8 employees.'Use Query Checker\u200bSometimes the Language Model generates invalid SQL with small mistakes that can be self-corrected using the same technique used by the SQL Database Agent to try and fix the SQL using the LLM. You can simply specify this option when creating the chain:db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True, use_query_checker=True)db_chain.run(\"How many albums by Aerosmith?\")            > Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...

'There is 1 album by Aerosmith.'Customize Prompt\u200bYou can also customize the prompt that is used. Here is an example prompting it to understand that foobar is the same as the Employee tablefrom langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.Use the following format:Question: \"Question here\"SQLQuery: \"SQL Query to run\"SQLResult: \"Result of the SQLQuery\"Answer: \"Final answer here\"Only use the following tables:{table_info}If someone asks for the table foobar, they really mean the employee table.Question: {input}\"\"\"PROMPT = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[\"input\", \"table_info\", \"dialect\"], template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE)db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, prompt=PROMPT, verbose=True)db_chain.run(\"How many employees are there in the foobar table?\")            > Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...

For example, if you know that the first few rows of a table are uninformative, it could help to manually provide example rows that are more diverse or provide more information to the model. It is also possible to limit the columns that will be visible to the model if there are unnecessary columns. This information can be provided as a dictionary with table names as the keys and table information as the values. For example, let's provide a custom definition and sample rows for the Track table with only a few columns:custom_table_info = {    \"Track\": \"\"\"CREATE TABLE Track (    \"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,     \"Name\" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,    \"Composer\" NVARCHAR(220),    PRIMARY KEY (\"TrackId\"))/*3 rows from Track table:TrackId Name    Composer1   For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson2   Balls to the Wall   None3   My favorite song ever   The coolest composer of all time*/\"\"\"}db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(    \"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\",    include_tables=['Track', 'Playlist'],    sample_rows_in_table_info=2,    custom_table_info=custom_table_info)print(db.table_info)        CREATE TABLE \"Playlist\" (        \"PlaylistId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,         \"Name\" NVARCHAR(120),         PRIMARY KEY (\"PlaylistId\")    )        /*    2 rows from Playlist table:    PlaylistId  Name    1   Music    2   Movies    */        CREATE TABLE Track (        \"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,         \"Name\" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,        \"Composer\" NVARCHAR(220),        PRIMARY KEY (\"TrackId\")    )    /*    3 rows from Track table:    TrackId Name    Composer    1   For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson    2   Balls to the Wall   None    3   My favorite song ever   The coolest composer of all time    */Note how our custom table definition and sample rows for Track overrides the sample_rows_in_table_info parameter.

For this reason, a custom SQL views can help.CREATE VIEW accounts_v AS    select id, firstname, lastname, email, created_at, updated_at,        cast(stats->>'total_post' as int) as total_post,        cast(stats->>'total_comments' as int) as total_comments,        cast(stats->>'ltv' as int) as ltv        FROM accounts;Then limit the tables visible from SQLDatabase to the created view.db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(    \"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\",    include_tables=['accounts_v']) # we include only the viewSQLDatabaseSequentialChain\u200bChain for querying SQL database that is a sequential chain.The chain is as follows:1. Based on the query, determine which tables to use.2. Based on those tables, call the normal SQL database chain.This is useful in cases where the number of tables in the database is large.from langchain.chains import SQLDatabaseSequentialChaindb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\")chain = SQLDatabaseSequentialChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)chain.run(\"How many employees are also customers?\")            > Entering new SQLDatabaseSequentialChain chain...

'59 employees are also customers.'Using Local Language Models\u200bSometimes you may not have the luxury of using OpenAI or other service-hosted large language model. You can, ofcourse, try to use the SQLDatabaseChain with a local model, but will quickly realize that most models you can run locally even with a large GPU struggle to generate the right output.import loggingimport torchfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, GPT2TokenizerFast, pipeline, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoModelForCausalLMfrom langchain import HuggingFacePipeline# Note: This model requires a large GPU, e.g. an 80GB A100.

However, you can log its inputs and outputs so that you can hand-correct them and use the corrected examples for few shot prompt examples later. In practice, you could log any executions of your chain that raise exceptions (as shown in the example below) or get direct user feedback in cases where the results are incorrect (but did not raise an exception).poetry run pip install pyyaml chromadbimport yaml    huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.

This type of radiation is the result of the thermal motion of the body's atoms and molecules, and it is emitted at all wavelengths. The spectrum of radiation emitted is described by Planck's law and is known as the black body spectrum.print(    chain.run(        \"What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3\"    ))            > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...    math: {'input': 'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3'}    > Finished chain.    ?

        "page_content": "EvaluationLanguage models can be unpredictable. This makes it challenging to ship reliable applications to production, where repeatable, useful outcomes across diverse inputs are a minimum requirement. Tests help demonstrate each component in an LLM application can produce the required or expected functionality. These tests also safeguard against regressions while you improve interconnected pieces of an integrated system. However, measuring the quality of generated text can be challenging. It can be hard to agree on the right set of metrics for your application, and it can be difficult to translate those into better performance. Furthermore, it's common to lack sufficient evaluation data to adequately test the range of inputs and expected outputs for each component when you're just getting started. The LangChain community is building open source tools and guides to help address these challenges.LangChain exposes different types of evaluators for common types of evaluation. Each type has off-the-shelf implementations you can use to get started, as well as an\nextensible API so you can create your own or contribute improvements for everyone to use. The following sections have example notebooks for you to get started.String Evaluators: Evaluate the predicted string for a given input, usually against a reference stringTrajectory Evaluators: Evaluate the whole trajectory of agent actionsComparison Evaluators: Compare predictions from two runs on a common inputThis section also provides some additional examples of how you could use these evaluators for different scenarios or apply to different chain implementations in the LangChain library. Some examples include:Preference Scoring Chain Outputs: An example using a comparison evaluator on different models or prompts to select statistically significant differences in aggregate preference scoresReference Docs\u200bFor detailed information of the available evaluators, including how to instantiate, configure, and customize them.

Currently supported strategies are \"hi_res\" (the default) and \"fast\". Hi res partitioning strategies are more accurate, but take longer to process. Fast strategies partition the document more quickly, but trade-off accuracy. Not all document types have separate hi res and fast partitioning strategies. For those document types, the strategy kwarg is ignored. In some cases, the high res strategy will fallback to fast if there is a dependency missing (i.e. a model for document partitioning). You can see how to apply a strategy to an UnstructuredFileLoader below.from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredFileLoaderloader = UnstructuredFileLoader(    \"layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf\", strategy=\"fast\", mode=\"elements\")docs = loader.load()docs[:5]    [Document(page_content='1', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'filename': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'page_number': 1, 'category': 'UncategorizedText'}, lookup_index=0),     Document(page_content='2', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'filename': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'page_number': 1, 'category': 'UncategorizedText'}, lookup_index=0),     Document(page_content='0', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'filename': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'page_number': 1, 'category': 'UncategorizedText'}, lookup_index=0),     Document(page_content='2', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'filename': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'page_number': 1, 'category': 'UncategorizedText'}, lookup_index=0),     Document(page_content='n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'filename': 'layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf', 'page_number': 1, 'category': 'Title'}, lookup_index=0)]PDF Example\u200bProcessing PDF documents works exactly the same way.

        "page_content": "Contextual compressionOne challenge with retrieval is that usually you don't know the specific queries your document storage system will face when you ingest data into the system. This means that the information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.Contextual compression is meant to fix this. The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning retrieved documents as-is, you can compress them using the context of the given query, so that only the relevant information is returned. \u201cCompressing\u201d here refers to both compressing the contents of an individual document and filtering out documents wholesale.To use the Contextual Compression Retriever, you'll need:a base Retrievera Document CompressorThe Contextual Compression Retriever passes queries to the base Retriever, takes the initial documents and passes them through the Document Compressor. The Document Compressor takes a list of Documents and shortens it by reducing the contents of Documents or dropping Documents altogether.Get started\u200b# Helper function for printing docsdef pretty_print_docs(docs):    print(f\"\\n{'-' * 100}\\n\".join([f\"Document {i+1}:\\n\\n\" + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)]))Using a vanilla vector store retriever\u200bLet's start by initializing a simple vector store retriever and storing the 2023 State of the Union speech (in chunks).

From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.         And soon, we\u2019ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.         So tonight I\u2019m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.          First, beat the opioid epidemic.Stringing compressors and document transformers togetherUsing the DocumentCompressorPipeline we can also easily combine multiple compressors in sequence. Along with compressors we can add BaseDocumentTransformers to our pipeline, which don't perform any contextual compression but simply perform some transformation on a set of documents. For example TextSplitters can be used as document transformers to split documents into smaller pieces, and the EmbeddingsRedundantFilter can be used to filter out redundant documents based on embedding similarity between documents.Below we create a compressor pipeline by first splitting our docs into smaller chunks, then removing redundant documents, and then filtering based on relevance to the query.from langchain.document_transformers import EmbeddingsRedundantFilterfrom langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import DocumentCompressorPipelinefrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplittersplitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=0, separator=\". \")redundant_filter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=embeddings)relevant_filter = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76)pipeline_compressor = DocumentCompressorPipeline(    transformers=[splitter, redundant_filter, relevant_filter])compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=pipeline_compressor, base_retriever=retriever)compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(\"What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown\")pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)    Document 1:        One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

This serverless architecture enables you to focus on writing and deploying code, while AWS automatically takes care of scaling, patching, and managing the infrastructure required to run your applications.By including a awslambda in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to invoke code running in your AWS Cloud for whatever purposes you need.When an Agent uses the awslambda tool, it will provide an argument of type string which will in turn be passed into the Lambda function via the event parameter.First, you need to install boto3 python package.pip install boto3 > /dev/nullIn order for an agent to use the tool, you must provide it with the name and description that match the functionality of you lambda function's logic. You must also provide the name of your function. Note that because this tool is effectively just a wrapper around the boto3 library, you will need to run aws configure in order to make use of the tool.

In the previous example where we didn't collect the metadata, we managed to directly specify in the schema where the value for the page_content can be extracted from..messages[].contentIn the current example, we have to tell the loader to iterate over the records in the messages field. The jq_schema then has to be:.messages[]This allows us to pass the records (dict) into the metadata_func that has to be implemented. The metadata_func is responsible for identifying which pieces of information in the record should be included in the metadata stored in the final Document object.Additionally, we now have to explicitly specify in the loader, via the content_key argument, the key from the record where the value for the page_content needs to be extracted from.# Define the metadata extraction function.def metadata_func(record: dict, metadata: dict) -> dict:    metadata[\"sender_name\"] = record.get(\"sender_name\")    metadata[\"timestamp_ms\"] = record.get(\"timestamp_ms\")    return metadataloader = JSONLoader(    file_path='./example_data/facebook_chat.json',    jq_schema='.messages[]',    content_key=\"content\",    metadata_func=metadata_func)data = loader.load()pprint(data)    [Document(page_content='Bye!', metadata={'source': '/Users/avsolatorio/WBG/langchain/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/example_data/facebook_chat.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'sender_name': 'User 2', 'timestamp_ms': 1675597571851}),     Document(page_content='Oh no worries!

This allows full control to the user with respect to how the metadata is formatted.For example, the default metadata contains the source and the seq_num keys. However, it is possible that the JSON data contain these keys as well. The user can then exploit the metadata_func to rename the default keys and use the ones from the JSON data.The example below shows how we can modify the source to only contain information of the file source relative to the langchain directory.# Define the metadata extraction function.def metadata_func(record: dict, metadata: dict) -> dict:    metadata[\"sender_name\"] = record.get(\"sender_name\")    metadata[\"timestamp_ms\"] = record.get(\"timestamp_ms\")    if \"source\" in metadata:        source = metadata[\"source\"].split(\"/\")        source = source[source.index(\"langchain\"):]        metadata[\"source\"] = \"/\".join(source)    return metadataloader = JSONLoader(    file_path='./example_data/facebook_chat.json',    jq_schema='.messages[]',    content_key=\"content\",    metadata_func=metadata_func)data = loader.load()pprint(data)    [Document(page_content='Bye!', metadata={'source': 'langchain/docs/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/example_data/facebook_chat.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'sender_name': 'User 2', 'timestamp_ms': 1675597571851}),     Document(page_content='Oh no worries!

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue\u2026 it\u2019s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone\u2019s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\u2019s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\u2019t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I\u2019m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.  Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation\u2026.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over\u2026.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room\u2026..I thought the phone was toast and i\u2019d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room\u2026..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug\u2026no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves\u2026..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug\u2026.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable\u2026or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone\u2026not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\u2019ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!  I didn\u2019t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work\u2026 my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+. Tried a lot of things and eventually downloaded all my images and videos to my PC and restarted the phone - problem solved.

        "page_content": "AgentsThe core idea of agents is to use an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take.\nIn chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code).\nIn agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.There are several key components here:Agent\u200bThis is the class responsible for deciding what step to take next.\nThis is powered by a language model and a prompt.\nThis prompt can include things like:The personality of the agent (useful for having it respond in a certain way)Background context for the agent (useful for giving it more context on the types of tasks it's being asked to do)Prompting strategies to invoke better reasoning (the most famous/widely used being ReAct)LangChain provides a few different types of agents to get started.\nEven then, you will likely want to customize those agents with parts (1) and (2).\nFor a full list of agent types see agent typesTools\u200bTools are functions that an agent calls.\nThere are two important considerations here:Giving the agent access to the right toolsDescribing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agentWithout both, the agent you are trying to build will not work.\nIf you don't give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objective.\nIf you don't describe the tools properly, the agent won't know how to properly use them.LangChain provides a wide set of tools to get started, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions).\nFor a full list of tools, see hereToolkits\u200bOften the set of tools an agent has access to is more important than a single tool.\nFor this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of tools needed to accomplish specific objectives.\nThere are generally around 3-5 tools in a toolkit.LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started.\nFor a full list of toolkits, see hereAgentExecutor\u200bThe agent executor is the runtime for an agent.\nThis is what actually calls the agent and executes the actions it chooses.\nPseudocode for this runtime is below:next_action = agent.get_action(...)while next_action != AgentFinish:    observation = run(next_action)    next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation)return next_actionWhile this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including:Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent toolHandling cases where the tool errorsHandling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocationLogging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) either to stdout or LangSmith.Other types of agent runtimes\u200bThe AgentExecutor class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain.\nHowever, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support.\nThese include:Plan-and-execute AgentBaby AGIAuto GPTGet started\u200bThis will go over how to get started building an agent.\nWe will use a LangChain agent class, but show how to customize it to give it specific context.\nWe will then define custom tools, and then run it all in the standard LangChain AgentExecutor.Set up the agent\u200bWe will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent.\nThis is easiest and best agent to get started with.\nIt does however require usage of ChatOpenAI models.\nIf you want to use a different language model, we would recommend using the ReAct agent.For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool.\nWe are choosing this example because we think for most use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools.\nThe tool we will give the agent is a tool to calculate the length of a word.\nThis is useful because this is actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization.\nWe will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in.\nMemory is needed to enable conversation.First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)Next, let's define some tools to use.\nLet's write a really simple Python function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in.from langchain.agents import tool@tooldef get_word_length(word: str) -> int:    \"\"\"Returns the length of a word.\"\"\"    return len(word)tools = [get_word_length]Now let us create the prompt.\nWe can use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt helper function to create a prompt automatically.\nThis allows for a few different ways to customize, including passing in a custom SystemMessage, which we will do.from langchain.schema import SystemMessagesystem_message = SystemMessage(content=\"You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words.\")prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt(system_message=system_message)Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent.from langchain.agents import OpenAIFunctionsAgentagent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)Finally, we create the AgentExecutor -

'There are 5 letters in the word \"educa\".'This is great - we have an agent!\nHowever, this agent is stateless - it doesn't remember anything about previous interactions.\nThis means you can't ask follow up questions easily.\nLet's fix that by adding in memory.In order to do this, we need to do two things:Add a place for memory variables to go in the promptAdd memory to the AgentExecutor (note that we add it here, and NOT to the agent, as this is the outermost chain)First, let's add a place for memory in the prompt.\nWe do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key \"chat_history\".from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholderMEMORY_KEY = \"chat_history\"prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt(    system_message=system_message,    extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY)])Next, let's create a memory object.\nWe will do this by using ConversationBufferMemory.\nImportantly, we set memory_key also equal to \"chat_history\" (to align it with the prompt) and set return_messages (to make it return messages rather than a string).from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemorymemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=MEMORY_KEY, return_messages=True)We can then put it all together!agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True)agent_executor.run(\"how many letters in the word educa?\")agent_executor.run(\"is that a real word?\")",

        "page_content": "LLMsinfoHead to Integrations for documentation on built-in integrations with LLM providers.Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.\nLangChain does not serve its own LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface for interacting with many different LLMs.Get started\u200bThere are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - the LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.In this walkthrough we'll work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types.Setup\u200bTo start we'll need to install the OpenAI Python package:pip install openaiAccessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:from langchain.llms import OpenAIllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\"...\")otherwise you can initialize without any params:from langchain.llms import OpenAIllm = OpenAI()__call__: string in -> string out\u200bThe simplest way to use an LLM is a callable: pass in a string, get a string completion.llm(\"Tell me a joke\")    'Why did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side.'generate: batch calls, richer outputs\u200bgenerate lets you can call the model with a list of strings, getting back a more complete response than just the text. This complete response can includes things like multiple top responses and other LLM provider-specific information:llm_result = llm.generate([\"Tell me a joke\", \"Tell me a poem\"]*15)len(llm_result.generations)    30llm_result.generations[0]    [Generation(text='\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!'),     Generation(text='\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side.')]llm_result.generations[-1]    [Generation(text=\"\\n\\nWhat if love neverspeech\\n\\nWhat if love never ended\\n\\nWhat if love was only a feeling\\n\\nI'll never know this love\\n\\nIt's not a feeling\\n\\nBut it's what we have for each other\\n\\nWe just know that love is something strong\\n\\nAnd we can't help but be happy\\n\\nWe just feel what love is for us\\n\\nAnd we love each other with all our heart\\n\\nWe just don't know how\\n\\nHow it will go\\n\\nBut we know that love is something strong\\n\\nAnd we'll always have each other\\n\\nIn our lives.\"),     Generation(text='\\n\\nOnce upon a time\\n\\nThere was a love so pure and true\\n\\nIt lasted for centuries\\n\\nAnd never became stale or dry\\n\\nIt was moving and alive\\n\\nAnd the heart of the love-ick\\n\\nIs still beating strong and true.')]You can also access provider specific information that is returned.

In this guide we will go over how to setup the PromptLayerCallbackHandler. While PromptLayer does have LLMs that integrate directly with LangChain (eg PromptLayerOpenAI), this callback is the recommended way to integrate PromptLayer with LangChain.See our docs for more information.Installation and Setup\u200bpip install promptlayer --upgradeGetting API Credentials\u200bIf you do not have a PromptLayer account, create one on promptlayer.com. Then get an API key by clicking on the settings cog in the navbar and\nset it as an environment variabled called PROMPTLAYER_API_KEYUsage\u200bGetting started with PromptLayerCallbackHandler is fairly simple, it takes two optional arguments:pl_tags - an optional list of strings that will be tracked as tags on PromptLayer.pl_id_callback - an optional function that will take promptlayer_request_id as an argument. This ID can be used with all of PromptLayer's tracking features to track, metadata, scores, and prompt usage.Simple OpenAI Example\u200bIn this simple example we use PromptLayerCallbackHandler with ChatOpenAI.

Using the Prompt Registry, we can programatically fetch the prompt template called example.We also define a pl_id_callback function which takes in the promptlayer_request_id and logs a score, metadata and links the prompt template used.

        "page_content": "VectaraWhat is Vectara?Vectara Overview:Vectara is developer-first API platform for building GenAI applicationsTo use Vectara - first sign up and create an account. Then create a corpus and an API key for indexing and searching.You can use Vectara's indexing API to add documents into Vectara's indexYou can use Vectara's Search API to query Vectara's index (which also supports Hybrid search implicitly).You can use Vectara's integration with LangChain as a Vector store or using the Retriever abstraction.Installation and Setup\u200bTo use Vectara with LangChain no special installation steps are required. You just have to provide your customer_id, corpus ID, and an API key created within the Vectara console to enable indexing and searching.Alternatively these can be provided as environment variablesexport VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID=\"your_customer_id\"export VECTARA_CORPUS_ID=\"your_corpus_id\"export VECTARA_API_KEY=\"your-vectara-api-key\"Usage\u200bVectorStore\u200bThere exists a wrapper around the Vectara platform, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for semantic search or example selection.To import this vectorstore:from langchain.vectorstores import VectaraTo create an instance of the Vectara vectorstore:vectara = Vectara(    vectara_customer_id=customer_id,     vectara_corpus_id=corpus_id,     vectara_api_key=api_key)The customer_id, corpus_id and api_key are optional, and if they are not supplied will be read from the environment variables VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID, VECTARA_CORPUS_ID and VECTARA_API_KEY, respectively.After you have the vectorstore, you can add_texts or add_documents as per the standard VectorStore interface, for example:vectara.add_texts([\"to be or not to be\", \"that is the question\"])Since Vectara supports file-upload, we also added the ability to upload files (PDF, TXT, HTML, PPT, DOC, etc) directly as file. When using this method, the file is uploaded directly to the Vectara backend, processed and chunked optimally there, so you don't have to use the LangChain document loader or chunking mechanism.As an example:vectara.add_files([\"path/to/file1.pdf\", \"path/to/file2.pdf\",...])To query the vectorstore, you can use the similarity_search method (or similarity_search_with_score), which takes a query string and returns a list of results:results = vectara.similarity_score(\"what is LangChain?\")similarity_search_with_score also supports the following additional arguments:k: number of results to return (defaults to 5)lambda_val: the lexical matching factor for hybrid search (defaults to 0.025)filter: a filter to apply to the results (default None)n_sentence_context: number of sentences to include before/after the actual matching segment when returning results. This defaults to 0 so as to return the exact text segment that matches, but can be used with other values e.g. 2 or 3 to return adjacent text segments.The results are returned as a list of relevant documents, and a relevance score of each document.For a more detailed examples of using the Vectara wrapper, see one of these two sample notebooks:Chat Over Documents with VectaraVectara Text Generation",

The \"qa\" evaluator compares a question-answering model's response to a reference answer to provide this level of information. If you are able to annotate a test dataset, this evaluator will be useful.For more details, check out the reference docs for the QAEvalChain's class definition.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.evaluation import load_evaluatorllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0)# Note: the eval_llm is optional.

Both queries are trying to calculate the sum of sales amounts for the last quarter. They both use the SUM function to add up the sale_amount from the sales table. They also both use the same WHERE clause to filter the sales data to only include sales from the last quarter. The WHERE clause uses the DATEADD function to subtract 1 quarter from the current date (GETDATE()) and only includes sales where the sale_date is greater than or equal to this date and less than the current date.\\n\\nThe main difference between the two queries is that the expert answer uses a subquery to first select the sale_amount from the sales table with the appropriate date filter, and then sums these amounts in the outer query. The submission, on the other hand, does not use a subquery and instead sums the sale_amount directly in the main query with the same date filter.\\n\\nHowever, this difference does not affect the result of the query.

LLMs in LangChain refer to pure text completion models.\nThe APIs they wrap take a string prompt as input and output a string completion. OpenAI's GPT-3 is implemented as an LLM.\nChat models are often backed by LLMs but tuned specifically for having conversations.\nAnd, crucially, their provider APIs expose a different interface than pure text completion models. Instead of a single string,\nthey take a list of chat messages as input. Usually these messages are labeled with the speaker (usually one of \"System\",\n\"AI\", and \"Human\"). And they return a (\"AI\") chat message as output. GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude are both implemented as Chat Models.To make it possible to swap LLMs and Chat Models, both implement the Base Language Model interface. This exposes common\nmethods \"predict\", which takes a string and returns a string, and \"predict messages\", which takes messages and returns a message.\nIf you are using a specific model it's recommended you use the methods specific to that model class (i.e., \"predict\" for LLMs and \"predict messages\" for Chat Models),\nbut if you're creating an application that should work with different types of models the shared interface can be helpful.",

The girl, dressed in a cheerful yellow frock, holds onto the umbrella with both hands while gazing up at Totoro with an expression of wonder and delight.        Totoro, meanwhile, stands tall and proud beside his young friend, holding his own umbrella aloft to protect them both from the downpour.

In the background of the scene, a street sign can be seen jutting out from the pavement amidst a flurry of raindrops.

Therefore, the answer is no, a dog cannot drive a car.Stop SequencesYou can also specify stop sequences. If you have a definite stop sequence for the generation that you are going to parse with anyway, it is better (cheaper and faster!) to just cancel the generation once one or more stop sequences are reached, rather than letting the model ramble on till the specified max_length. Stop sequences work regardless of whether you are in streaming mode or not, and Replicate only charges you for the generation up until the stop sequence.import timellm = Replicate(    model=\"a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat:df7690f1994d94e96ad9d568eac121aecf50684a0b0963b25a41cc40061269e5\",    input={\"temperature\": 0.01, \"max_length\": 500, \"top_p\": 1},)prompt = \"\"\"User: What is the best way to learn python?Assistant:\"\"\"start_time = time.perf_counter()raw_output = llm(prompt)  # raw output, no stopend_time = time.perf_counter()print(f\"Raw output:\\n {raw_output}\")print(f\"Raw output runtime: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")start_time = time.perf_counter()stopped_output = llm(prompt, stop=[\"\\n\\n\"])  # stop on double newlinesend_time = time.perf_counter()print(f\"Stopped output:\\n {stopped_output}\")print(f\"Stopped output runtime: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")    Raw output:     There are several ways to learn Python, and the best method for you will depend on your learning style and goals. Here are a few suggestions:        1. Online tutorials and courses: Websites such as Codecademy, Coursera, and edX offer interactive coding lessons and courses on Python. These can be a great way to get started, especially if you prefer a self-paced approach.    2. Books: There are many excellent books on Python that can provide a comprehensive introduction to the language. Some popular options include \"Python Crash Course\" by Eric Matthes, \"Learning Python\" by Mark Lutz, and \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Sweigart.    3. Online communities: Participating in online communities such as Reddit's r/learnpython community or Python communities on Discord can be a great way to get support and feedback as you learn.    4. Practice: The best way to learn Python is by doing. Start by writing simple programs and gradually work your way up to more complex projects.    5. Find a mentor: Having a mentor who is experienced in Python can be a great way to get guidance and feedback as you learn.    6. Join online meetups and events: Joining online meetups and events can be a great way to connect with other Python learners and get a sense of the community.    7. Use a Python IDE: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides an interface for writing, debugging, and testing code. Using a Python IDE such as PyCharm, VSCode, or Spyder can make writing and debugging Python code much easier.    8. Learn by building: One of the best ways to learn Python is by building projects. Start with small projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.    9. Learn from others: Look at other people's code, understand how it works and try to implement it in your own way.    10. Be patient: Learning a programming language takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself and don't get discouraged if you don't understand something at first.

It has been serialized in Shueisha\\'s sh\u014dnen manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tank\u014dbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\\nHunter \u00d7 Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter \u00d7 Hunter.\\nThe manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\\nHunter \u00d7 Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.\\n\\nPage: Hunter \u00d7 Hunter (2011 TV series)\\nSummary: Hunter \u00d7 Hunter is an anime television series that aired from 2011 to 2014 based on Yoshihiro Togashi\\'s manga series Hunter \u00d7 Hunter. The story begins with a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the father who he thought was dead, is in fact alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging, is a legendary \"Hunter\", an individual who has proven themselves an elite member of humanity. Despite the fact that Ging left his son with his relatives in order to pursue his own dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow in his father\\'s footsteps, pass the rigorous \"Hunter Examination\", and eventually find his father to become a Hunter in his own right.\\nThis new Hunter \u00d7 Hunter anime was announced on July 24, 2011. It is a complete reboot starting from the beginning of the original manga, with no connection to the first anime television series from 1999. Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is directed by Hiroshi K\u014djina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. Instead of having the old cast reprise their roles for the new adaptation, the series features an entirely new cast to voice the characters. The new series premiered airing weekly on Nippon TV and the nationwide Nippon News Network from October 2, 2011.  The series started to be collected in both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23, 2019.The anime series\\' opening theme is alternated between the song \"Departure!\" and an alternate version titled \"Departure! -Second Version-\" both sung by Galneryus\\' voc'",

This notebook was originally published at filipmichalsky/SalesGPT by @FilipMichalsky.SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. Additionally, the AI Sales agent has access to tools, which allow it to interact with other systems.Here, we show how the AI Sales Agent can use a Product Knowledge Base to speak about a particular's company offerings,\nhence increasing relevance and reducing hallucinations.We leverage the langchain library in this implementation, specifically Custom Agent Configuration and are inspired by BabyAGI architecture .Import Libraries and Set Up Your Environment\u200bimport osimport re# import your OpenAI keyOPENAI_API_KEY = \"sk-xx\"os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = OPENAI_API_KEYfrom typing import Dict, List, Any, Union, Callablefrom pydantic import BaseModel, Fieldfrom langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplatefrom langchain.llms import BaseLLMfrom langchain.chains.base import Chainfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.agents import Tool, LLMSingleActionAgent, AgentExecutorfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQAfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.prompts.base import StringPromptTemplatefrom langchain.agents.agent import AgentOutputParserfrom langchain.agents.conversational.prompt import FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONSfrom langchain.schema import AgentAction, AgentFinish# install aditional dependencies# ! pip install chromadb openai tiktokenSalesGPT architecture\u200bSeed the SalesGPT agentRun Sales Agent to decide what to do:a) Use a tool, such as look up Product Information in a Knowledge Baseb) Output a response to a user Run Sales Stage Recognition Agent to recognize which stage is the sales agent at and adjust their behaviour accordingly.Here is the schematic of the architecture:Architecture diagram\u200bSales conversation stages.\u200bThe agent employs an assistant who keeps it in check as in what stage of the conversation it is in.

Currently, only some chains support this type of serialization. We will grow the number of supported chains over time.Saving a chain to disk\u200bFirst, let's go over how to save a chain to disk. This can be done with the .save method, and specifying a file path with a json or yaml extension.from langchain import PromptTemplate, OpenAI, LLMChaintemplate = \"\"\"Question: {question}Answer: Let's think step by step.\"\"\"prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[\"question\"])llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), verbose=True)llm_chain.save(\"llm_chain.json\")Let's now take a look at what's inside this saved filecat llm_chain.json    {        \"memory\": null,        \"verbose\": true,        \"prompt\": {            \"input_variables\": [                \"question\"            ],            \"output_parser\": null,            \"template\": \"Question: {question}\\n\\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\",            \"template_format\": \"f-string\"        },        \"llm\": {            \"model_name\": \"text-davinci-003\",            \"temperature\": 0.0,            \"max_tokens\": 256,            \"top_p\": 1,            \"frequency_penalty\": 0,            \"presence_penalty\": 0,            \"n\": 1,            \"best_of\": 1,            \"request_timeout\": null,            \"logit_bias\": {},            \"_type\": \"openai\"        },        \"output_key\": \"text\",        \"_type\": \"llm_chain\"    }Loading a chain from disk\u200bWe can load a chain from disk by using the load_chain method.from langchain.chains import load_chainchain = load_chain(\"llm_chain.json\")chain.run(\"whats 2 + 2\")            > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Alternatively, we can split them up and save them separately. This is often useful to make the saved components more modular.

        "page_content": "Connecting to a Feature StoreFeature stores are a concept from traditional machine learning that make sure data fed into models is up-to-date and relevant. For more on this, see here.This concept is extremely relevant when considering putting LLM applications in production. In order to personalize LLM applications, you may want to combine LLMs with up-to-date information about particular users. Feature stores can be a great way to keep that data fresh, and LangChain provides an easy way to combine that data with LLMs.In this notebook we will show how to connect prompt templates to feature stores. The basic idea is to call a feature store from inside a prompt template to retrieve values that are then formatted into the prompt.Feast\u200bTo start, we will use the popular open source feature store framework Feast.This assumes you have already run the steps in the README around getting started. We will build of off that example in getting started, and create and LLMChain to write a note to a specific driver regarding their up-to-date statistics.Load Feast Store\u200bAgain, this should be set up according to the instructions in the Feast READMEfrom feast import FeatureStore# You may need to update the path depending on where you stored itfeast_repo_path = \"../../../../../my_feature_repo/feature_repo/\"store = FeatureStore(repo_path=feast_repo_path)Prompts\u200bHere we will set up a custom FeastPromptTemplate.

And remember, even chickens can't always cross the road, but they still give it their best shot.\"Tecton\u200bAbove, we showed how you could use Feast, a popular open source and self-managed feature store, with LangChain. Our examples below will show a similar integration using Tecton. Tecton is a fully managed feature platform built to orchestrate the complete ML feature lifecycle, from transformation to online serving, with enterprise-grade SLAs.Prerequisites\u200bTecton Deployment (sign up at https://tecton.ai)TECTON_API_KEY environment variable set to a valid Service Account keyDefine and Load Features\u200bWe will use the user_transaction_counts Feature View from the Tecton tutorial as part of a Feature Service. For simplicity, we are only using a single Feature View; however, more sophisticated applications may require more feature views to retrieve the features needed for its prompt.user_transaction_metrics = FeatureService(    name = \"user_transaction_metrics\",    features = [user_transaction_counts])The above Feature Service is expected to be applied to a live workspace. For this example, we will be using the \"prod\" workspace.import tectonworkspace = tecton.get_workspace(\"prod\")feature_service = workspace.get_feature_service(\"user_transaction_metrics\")Prompts\u200bHere we will set up a custom TectonPromptTemplate.

TruLens has a number of out-of-the-box Feedback Functions, and is also an extensible framework for LLM evaluation.# create a feedback functionfrom trulens_eval.feedback import Feedback, Huggingface, OpenAI# Initialize HuggingFace-based feedback function collection class:hugs = Huggingface()openai = OpenAI()# Define a language match feedback function using HuggingFace.lang_match = Feedback(hugs.language_match).on_input_output()# By default this will check language match on the main app input and main app# output.# Question/answer relevance between overall question and answer.qa_relevance = Feedback(openai.relevance).on_input_output()# By default this will evaluate feedback on main app input and main app output.# Toxicity of inputtoxicity = Feedback(openai.toxicity).on_input()After you've set up Feedback Function(s) for evaluating your LLM, you can wrap your application with TruChain to get detailed tracing, logging and evaluation of your LLM app.# wrap your chain with TruChaintruchain = TruChain(    chain,    app_id='Chain1_ChatApplication',    feedbacks=[lang_match, qa_relevance, toxicity])# Note: any `feedbacks` specified here will be evaluated and logged whenever the chain is used.truchain(\"que hora es?\")Now you can explore your LLM-based application!Doing so will help you understand how your LLM application is performing at a glance. As you iterate new versions of your LLM application, you can compare their performance across all of the different quality metrics you've set up. You'll also be able to view evaluations at a record level, and explore the chain metadata for each record.tru.run_dashboard() # open a Streamlit app to exploreFor more information on TruLens, visit trulens.org",

The free api key has 5 calls per seconds quota.The loader supports the following six functinalities:Retrieve normal transactions under specifc account on Ethereum MainetRetrieve internal transactions under specifc account on Ethereum MainetRetrieve erc20 transactions under specifc account on Ethereum MainetRetrieve erc721 transactions under specifc account on Ethereum MainetRetrieve erc1155 transactions under specifc account on Ethereum MainetRetrieve ethereum balance in wei under specifc account on Ethereum MainetIf the account does not have corresponding transactions, the loader will a list with one document. The content of document is ''.You can pass differnt filters to loader to access different functionalities we mentioned above:\"normal_transaction\"\"internal_transaction\"\"erc20_transaction\"\"eth_balance\"\"erc721_transaction\"\"erc1155_transaction\"\nThe filter is default to normal_transactionIf you have any questions, you can access Etherscan API Doc or contact me via i@inevitable.tech.All functions related to transactions histories are restricted 1000 histories maximum because of Etherscan limit. You can use the following parameters to find the transaction histories you need:offset: default to 20. Shows 20 transactions for one timepage: default to 1. This controls pagenation.start_block: Default to 0. The transaction histories starts from 0 block.end_block: Default to 99999999.

Clarifai provides an AI platform with the full AI lifecycle for data exploration, data labeling, model training, evaluation and inference around images, video, text and audio data. In the LangChain ecosystem, as far as we're aware, Clarifai is the only provider that supports LLMs, embeddings and a vector store in one production scale platform, making it an excellent choice to operationalize your LangChain implementations.Installation and Setup\u200bInstall the Python SDK:pip install clarifaiSign-up for a Clarifai account, then get a personal access token to access the Clarifai API from your security settings and set it as an environment variable (CLARIFAI_PAT).Models\u200bClarifai provides 1,000s of AI models for many different use cases. You can explore them here to find the one most suited for your use case. These models include those created by other providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, AI21, etc. as well as state of the art from open source such as Falcon, InstructorXL, etc. so that you build the best in AI into your products. You'll find these organized by the creator's user_id and into projects we call applications denoted by their app_id. Those IDs will be needed in additional to the model_id and optionally the version_id, so make note of all these IDs once you found the best model for your use case!Also note that given there are many models for images, video, text and audio understanding, you can build some interested AI agents that utilize the variety of AI models as experts to understand those data types.LLMs\u200bTo find the selection of LLMs in the Clarifai platform you can select the text to text model type here.from langchain.llms import Clarifaillm = Clarifai(pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, model_id=MODEL_ID)For more details, the docs on the Clarifai LLM wrapper provide a detailed walkthrough.Text Embedding Models\u200bTo find the selection of text embeddings models in the Clarifai platform you can select the text to embedding model type here.There is a Clarifai Embedding model in LangChain, which you can access with:from langchain.embeddings import ClarifaiEmbeddingsembeddings = ClarifaiEmbeddings(pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, model_id=MODEL_ID)For more details, the docs on the Clarifai Embeddings wrapper provide a detailed walthrough.Vectorstore\u200bClarifai's vector DB was launched in 2016 and has been optimized to support live search queries. With workflows in the Clarifai platform, you data is automatically indexed by am embedding model and optionally other models as well to index that information in the DB for search. You can query the DB not only via the vectors but also filter by metadata matches, other AI predicted concepts, and even do geo-coordinate search. Simply create an application, select the appropriate base workflow for your type of data, and upload it (through the API as documented here or the UIs at clarifai.com).You an also add data directly from LangChain as well, and the auto-indexing will take place for you. You'll notice this is a little different than other vectorstores where you need to provde an embedding model in their constructor and have LangChain coordinate getting the embeddings from text and writing those to the index. Not only is it more convenient, but it's much more scalable to use Clarifai's distributed cloud to do all the index in the background.from langchain.vectorstores import Clarifaiclarifai_vector_db = Clarifai.from_texts(user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, texts=texts, pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, number_of_docs=NUMBER_OF_DOCS, metadatas = metadatas)For more details, the docs on the Clarifai vector store provide a detailed walthrough.",

The tree told Jack that if he was honest and trustworthy, he would be rewarded with a special gift. Jack was so excited, and he promised to always be honest and trustworthy. Sure enough, the tree rewarded Jack with a beautiful golden apple. From that day forward, Jack was always honest and trustworthy, and he was rewarded with many more magical gifts.

A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search\nfor you.Get started\u200bThis walkthrough showcases basic functionality related to VectorStores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the text embedding model interfaces before diving into this.There are many great vector store options, here are a few that are free, open-source, and run entirely on your local machine.

        "page_content": "MarkdownHeaderTextSplitterMotivation\u200bMany chat or Q+A applications involve chunking input documents prior to embedding and vector storage.These notes from Pinecone provide some useful tips:When a full paragraph or document is embedded, the embedding process considers both the overall context and the relationships between the sentences and phrases within the text. This can result in a more comprehensive vector representation that captures the broader meaning and themes of the text.As mentioned, chunking often aims to keep text with common context together.With this in mind, we might want to specifically honor the structure of the document itself.For example, a markdown file is organized by headers.Creating chunks within specific header groups is an intuitive idea.To address this challenge, we can use MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter.This will split a markdown file by a specified set of headers. For example, if we want to split this markdown:md = '# Foo\\n\\n ## Bar\\n\\nHi this is Jim  \\nHi this is Joe\\n\\n ## Baz\\n\\n Hi this is Molly' We can specify the headers to split on:[(\"#\", \"Header 1\"),(\"##\", \"Header 2\")]And content is grouped or split by common headers:{'content': 'Hi this is Jim  \\nHi this is Joe', 'metadata': {'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}}{'content': 'Hi this is Molly', 'metadata': {'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'}}Let's have a look at some examples below.from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplittermarkdown_document = \"# Foo\\n\\n    ## Bar\\n\\nHi this is Jim\\n\\nHi this is Joe\\n\\n ### Boo \\n\\n Hi this is Lance \\n\\n ## Baz\\n\\n Hi this is Molly\"headers_to_split_on = [    (\"#\", \"Header 1\"),    (\"##\", \"Header 2\"),    (\"###\", \"Header 3\"),]markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on)md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)md_header_splits    [Document(page_content='Hi this is Jim  \\nHi this is Joe', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}),     Document(page_content='Hi this is Lance', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar', 'Header 3': 'Boo'}),     Document(page_content='Hi this is Molly', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'})]type(md_header_splits[0])    langchain.schema.DocumentWithin each markdown group we can then apply any text splitter we want. markdown_document = \"# Intro \\n\\n    ## History \\n\\n Markdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

Within it, lies one of Voldemort's horcruxes, the locket. But beware, the labyrinth is heavily guarded by dark creatures and spells, and time is running out. Can you find the locket before it's too late?            (Harry Potter): I take a deep breath and ready my wand. I know this won't be easy, but I'm determined to find that locket and destroy it. I start making my way towards the Forbidden Forest, keeping an eye out for any signs of danger. As I enter the forest, I cast a protective spell around myself and begin to navigate through the trees. I keep my wand at the ready, prepared for any surprises that may come my way. It's going to be a long and difficult journey, but I won't give up until I find that horcrux. It is your turn, Dungeon Master.            (Dungeon Master): As you make your way through the Forbidden Forest, you hear the rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs. Suddenly, a group of acromantulas, giant spiders, emerge from the trees and begin to surround you. They hiss and bare their fangs, ready to attack. What do you do, Harry?            (Harry Potter): I quickly cast a spell to create a wall of fire between myself and the acromantulas. I know that they are afraid of fire, so this should keep them at bay for a while. I use this opportunity to continue moving forward, keeping my wand at the ready in case any other creatures try to attack me. I know that I can't let anything stop me from finding that horcrux. It is your turn, Dungeon Master.            (Dungeon Master): As you continue through the forest, you come across a clearing where you see a group of Death Eaters gathered around a cauldron. They seem to be performing some sort of dark ritual. You recognize one of them as Bellatrix Lestrange. What do you do, Harry?            (Harry Potter): I hide behind a nearby tree and observe the Death Eaters from a distance. I try to listen in on their conversation to see if I can gather any information about the horcrux or Voldemort's plans. If I can't hear anything useful, I'll wait for them to disperse before continuing on my journey. I know that confronting them directly would be too dangerous, especially with Bellatrix Lestrange present. It is your turn, Dungeon Master.            (Dungeon Master): As you listen in on the Death Eaters' conversation, you hear them mention the location of another horcrux - Nagini, Voldemort's snake. They plan to keep her hidden in a secret chamber within the Ministry of Magic. However, they also mention that the chamber is heavily guarded and only accessible through a secret passage. You realize that this could be a valuable piece of information and decide to make note of it before quietly slipping away. It is your turn, Harry Potter.        ",

https://files.clear.ml/langchain_callback_demo/llm.988bd727b0e94a29a3ac0ee526813545/models/simple_sequentialAt this point you can already go to https://app.clear.ml and take a look at the resulting ClearML Task that was created.Among others, you should see that this notebook is saved along with any git information. The model JSON that contains the used parameters is saved as an artifact, there are also console logs and under the plots section, you'll find tables that represent the flow of the chain.Finally, if you enabled visualizations, these are stored as HTML files under debug samples.Scenario 2: Creating an agent with tools\u200bTo show a more advanced workflow, let's create an agent with access to tools. The way ClearML tracks the results is not different though, only the table will look slightly different as there are other types of actions taken when compared to the earlier, simpler example.You can now also see the use of the finish=True keyword, which will fully close the ClearML Task, instead of just resetting the parameters and prompts for a new conversation.from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_toolsfrom langchain.agents import AgentType# SCENARIO 2 - Agent with Toolstools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm, callbacks=callbacks)agent = initialize_agent(    tools,    llm,    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,    callbacks=callbacks,)agent.run(\"Who is the wife of the person who sang summer of 69?\")clearml_callback.flush_tracker(    langchain_asset=agent, name=\"Agent with Tools\", finish=True)            > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...    {'action': 'on_chain_start', 'name': 'AgentExecutor', 'step': 1, 'starts': 1, 'ends': 0, 'errors': 0, 'text_ctr': 0, 'chain_starts': 1, 'chain_ends': 0, 'llm_starts': 0, 'llm_ends': 0, 'llm_streams': 0, 'tool_starts': 0, 'tool_ends': 0, 'agent_ends': 0, 'input': 'Who is the wife of the person who sang summer of 69?'}    {'action': 'on_llm_start', 'name': 'OpenAI', 'step': 2, 'starts': 2, 'ends': 0, 'errors': 0, 'text_ctr': 0, 'chain_starts': 1, 'chain_ends': 0, 'llm_starts': 1, 'llm_ends': 0, 'llm_streams': 0, 'tool_starts': 0, 'tool_ends': 0, 'agent_ends': 0, 'prompts': 'Answer the following questions as best you can.

        "page_content": "DocugamiThis notebook covers how to load documents from Docugami. It provides the advantages of using this system over alternative data loaders.Prerequisites\u200bInstall necessary python packages.Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable.Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api# You need the lxml package to use the DocugamiLoaderpip install lxmlQuick start\u200bCreate a Docugami workspace (free trials available)Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can change the docset assignments later.Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. Detailed instructionsExplore the Docugami API to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.Optionally, build and publish one or more reports or abstracts. This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like self-querying retriever to do high accuracy Document QA.Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques\u200bAppropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:Intelligent Chunking: Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.Structured Representation: In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.Semantic Annotations: Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.Additional Metadata: Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.import osfrom langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoaderLoad Documents\u200bIf the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable is set, there is no need to pass it in to the loader explicitly otherwise you can pass it in as the access_token parameter.DOCUGAMI_API_KEY = os.environ.get(\"DOCUGAMI_API_KEY\")# To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don't provide document_idsloader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=\"ecxqpipcoe2p\", document_ids=[\"43rj0ds7s0ur\"])docs = loader.load()docs    [Document(page_content='MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT This  Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement  (this \u201c Agreement \u201d) is entered into and made effective as of  April  4 ,  2018  between  Docugami Inc. , a  Delaware  corporation , whose address is  150  Lake Street South ,  Suite  221 ,  Kirkland ,  Washington  98033 , and  Caleb Divine , an individual, whose address is  1201  Rt  300 ,  Newburgh  NY  12550 .', metadata={'xpath': '/docset:MutualNon-disclosure/docset:MutualNon-disclosure/docset:MUTUALNON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT-section/docset:MUTUALNON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT/docset:ThisMutualNon-disclosureAgreement', 'id': '43rj0ds7s0ur', 'name': 'NDA simple layout.docx', 'structure': 'p', 'tag': 'ThisMutualNon-disclosureAgreement'}),     Document(page_content='The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).

We can just use the same code, but use the DocugamiLoader for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques.poetry run pip -q install openai tiktoken chromadbfrom langchain.schema import Documentfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documentsloader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=\"wh2kned25uqm\")documents = loader.load()The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don't need to use a text splitter.

Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI's powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly.chain_response = qa_chain(\"What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?\")chain_response[\"result\"]  # the correct answer should be 13,500    ' 9,753 square feet'At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but if you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, since they are far apart in the document. The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the Menlo Group landlord. That landlord happens to be mentioned on the first page of the file Shorebucks LLC_NJ.pdf file, and while one of the source chunks used by the chain is indeed from that doc that contains the correct answer (13,500), other source chunks from different docs are included, and the answer is therefore incorrect.chain_response[\"source_documents\"]    [Document(page_content='1.1 Landlord .

Chunks are annotated with additional metadata created using different techniques if a user has been using Docugami. More technical approaches will be added later.Specifically, let's look at the additional metadata that is returned on the documents returned by docugami, in the form of some simple key/value pairs on all the text chunks:loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=\"wh2kned25uqm\")documents = loader.load()documents[0].metadata    {'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT-section/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT/docset:ThisOfficeLeaseAgreement',     'id': 'v1bvgaozfkak',     'name': 'TruTone Lane 2.docx',     'structure': 'p',     'tag': 'ThisOfficeLeaseAgreement',     'Landlord': 'BUBBA CENTER PARTNERSHIP',     'Tenant': 'Truetone Lane LLC'}We can use a self-querying retriever to improve our query accuracy, using this additional metadata:from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfofrom langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetrieverEXCLUDE_KEYS = [\"id\", \"xpath\", \"structure\"]metadata_field_info = [    AttributeInfo(        name=key,        description=f\"The {key} for this chunk\",        type=\"string\",    )    for key in documents[0].metadata    if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS]document_content_description = \"Contents of this chunk\"llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(    llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True)qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True)    Using embedded DuckDB without persistence: data will be transientLet's run the same question again.

It helps data engineers and application developers access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.Cube\u2019s data model provides structure and definitions that are used as a context for LLM to understand data and generate correct queries. LLM doesn\u2019t need to navigate complex joins and metrics calculations because Cube abstracts those and provides a simple interface that operates on the business-level terminology, instead of SQL table and column names. This simplification helps LLM to be less error-prone and avoid hallucinations.Example\u200bInput arguments (mandatory)Cube Semantic Loader requires 2 arguments:cube_api_url: The URL of your Cube's deployment REST API.

You can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate's format_prompt -- this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.For convenience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like:template = (    \"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\")system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)human_template = \"{text}\"human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])# get a chat completion from the formatted messageschat(    chat_prompt.format_prompt(        input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\"    ).to_messages())    AIMessage(content=\"J'adore la programmation.\", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)",

Enterprise Search lets organizations quickly build generative AI powered search engines for customers and employees.Enterprise Search is underpinned by a variety of Google Search technologies, including semantic search, which helps deliver more relevant results than traditional keyword-based search techniques by using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to infer relationships within the content and intent from the user\u2019s query input. Enterprise Search also benefits from Google\u2019s expertise in understanding how users search and factors in content relevance to order displayed results. Google Cloud offers Enterprise Search via Gen App Builder in Google Cloud Console and via an API for enterprise workflow integration. This notebook demonstrates how to configure Enterprise Search and use the Enterprise Search retriever. The Enterprise Search retriever encapsulates the Generative AI App Builder Python client library and uses it to access the Enterprise Search Search Service API.Install pre-requisites\u200bYou need to install the google-cloud-discoverengine package to use the Enterprise Search retriever.pip install google-cloud-discoveryengineConfigure access to Google Cloud and Google Cloud Enterprise Search\u200bEnterprise Search is generally available for the allowlist (which means customers need to be approved for access) as of June 6, 2023. Contact your Google Cloud sales team for access and pricing details. We are previewing additional features that are coming soon to the generally available offering as part of our Trusted Tester program. Sign up for Trusted Tester and contact your Google Cloud sales team for an expedited trial.Before you can run this notebook you need to:Set or create a Google Cloud project and turn on Gen App BuilderCreate and populate an unstructured data storeSet credentials to access Enterprise Search APISet or create a Google Cloud poject and turn on Gen App Builder\u200bFollow the instructions in the Enterprise Search Getting Started guide to set/create a GCP project and enable Gen App Builder.Create and populate an unstructured data store\u200bUse Google Cloud Console to create an unstructured data store and populate it with the example PDF documents from the  gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/alphabet-investor-pdfs Cloud Storage folder. Make sure to use the Cloud Storage (without metadata) option.Set credentials to access Enterprise Search API\u200bThe Gen App Builder client libraries used by the Enterprise Search retriever provide high-level language support for authenticating to Gen App Builder programmatically. Client libraries support Application Default Credentials (ADC); the libraries look for credentials in a set of defined locations and use those credentials to authenticate requests to the API. With ADC, you can make credentials available to your application in a variety of environments, such as local development or production, without needing to modify your application code.If running in Google Colab authenticate with google.colab.google.auth otherwise follow one of the supported methods to make sure that you Application Default Credentials are properly set.import sysif \"google.colab\" in sys.modules:    from google.colab import auth as google_auth    google_auth.authenticate_user()Configure and use the Enterprise Search retriever\u200bThe Enterprise Search retriever is implemented in the langchain.retriever.GoogleCloudEntepriseSearchRetriever class. The get_relevan_documents method returns a list of langchain.schema.Document documents where the page_content field of each document is populated with either an extractive segment or an extractive answer that matches a query. The metadata field is populated with metadata (if any) of a document from which the segments or answers were extracted.An extractive answer is verbatim text that is returned with each search result. It is extracted directly from the original document. Extractive answers are typically displayed near the top of web pages to provide an end user with a brief answer that is contextually relevant to their query. Extractive answers are available for website and unstructured search.An extractive segment is verbatim text that is returned with each search result. An extractive segment is usually more verbose than an extractive answer. Extractive segments can be displayed as an answer to a query, and can be used to perform post-processing tasks and as input for large language models to generate answers or new text. Extractive segments are available for unstructured search.For more information about extractive segments and extractive answers refer to product documentation.When creating an instance of the retriever you can specify a number of parameters that control which Enterprise data store to access and how a natural language query is processed, including configurations for extractive answers and segments.The mandatory parameters are:project_id - Your Google Cloud PROJECT_IDsearch_engine_id - The ID of the data store you want to use. The project_id and search_engine_id parameters can be provided explicitly in the retriever's constructor or through the environment variables - PROJECT_ID and SEARCH_ENGINE_ID.You can also configure a number of optional parameters, including:max_documents - The maximum number of documents used to provide extractive segments or extractive answersget_extractive_answers - By default, the retriever is configured to return extractive segments. Set this field to True to return extractive answersmax_extractive_answer_count - The maximum number of extractive answers returned in each search result.\nAt most 5 answers will be returnedmax_extractive_segment_count - The maximum number of extractive segments returned in each search result.\nCurrently one segment will be returnedfilter - The filter expression that allows you filter the search results based on the metadata associated with the documents in the searched data store. query_expansion_condition - Specification to determine under which conditions query expansion should occur.\n0 - Unspecified query expansion condition. In this case, server behavior defaults to disabled.\n1 - Disabled query expansion. Only the exact search query is used, even if SearchResponse.total_size is zero.\n2 - Automatic query expansion built by the Search API.Configure and use the retriever with extractve segments\u200bfrom langchain.retrievers import GoogleCloudEnterpriseSearchRetrieverPROJECT_ID = \"<YOUR PROJECT ID>\"  # Set to your Project IDSEARCH_ENGINE_ID = \"<YOUR SEARCH ENGINE ID>\"  # Set to your data store IDretriever = GoogleCloudEnterpriseSearchRetriever(    project_id=PROJECT_ID,    search_engine_id=SEARCH_ENGINE_ID,    max_documents=3,)query = \"What are Alphabet's Other Bets?\"result = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)for doc in result:    print(doc)Configure and use the retriever with extractve answers\u200bretriever = GoogleCloudEnterpriseSearchRetriever(    project_id=PROJECT_ID,    search_engine_id=SEARCH_ENGINE_ID,    max_documents=3,    max_extractive_answer_count=3,    get_extractive_answers=True,)query = \"What are Alphabet's Other Bets?\"result = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)for doc in result:    print(doc)",

APIs act as the \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.LLM\u200bSee a usage example.from langchain.llms import AmazonAPIGatewayapi_url = \"https://<api_gateway_id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/LATEST/HF\"llm = AmazonAPIGateway(api_url=api_url)# These are sample parameters for Falcon 40B Instruct Deployed from Amazon SageMaker JumpStartparameters = {    \"max_new_tokens\": 100,    \"num_return_sequences\": 1,    \"top_k\": 50,    \"top_p\": 0.95,    \"do_sample\": False,    \"return_full_text\": True,    \"temperature\": 0.2,}prompt = \"what day comes after Friday?\"llm.model_kwargs = parametersllm(prompt)>>> 'what day comes after Friday?\\nSaturday'Agent\u200bfrom langchain.agents import load_toolsfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agentfrom langchain.agents import AgentTypefrom langchain.llms import AmazonAPIGatewayapi_url = \"https://<api_gateway_id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/LATEST/HF\"llm = AmazonAPIGateway(api_url=api_url)parameters = {    \"max_new_tokens\": 50,    \"num_return_sequences\": 1,    \"top_k\": 250,    \"top_p\": 0.25,    \"do_sample\": False,    \"temperature\": 0.1,}llm.model_kwargs = parameters# Next, let's load some tools to use.

Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the openai_api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIchat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=\"...\")otherwise you can initialize without any params:from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIchat = ChatOpenAI()Messages\u200bThe chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text.\nThe types of messages currently supported in LangChain are AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, and ChatMessage -- ChatMessage takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the time, you'll just be dealing with HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage__call__\u200bMessages in -> message out\u200bYou can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message.from langchain.schema import (    AIMessage,    HumanMessage,    SystemMessage)chat([HumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming.\")])    AIMessage(content=\"J'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})OpenAI's chat model supports multiple messages as input. See here for more information. Here is an example of sending a system and user message to the chat model:messages = [    SystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),    HumanMessage(content=\"I love programming.\")]chat(messages)    AIMessage(content=\"J'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})generate\u200bBatch calls, richer outputs\u200bYou can go one step further and generate completions for multiple sets of messages using generate.

When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to use  the custom tool more than the normal Search tool. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool.This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like 'who is the singer of yesterday?' or 'what is the most popular song in 2022?' to the description.An example is below.# Import things that are needed genericallyfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Toolfrom langchain.agents import AgentTypefrom langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain import LLMMathChain, SerpAPIWrappersearch = SerpAPIWrapper()tools = [    Tool(        name=\"Search\",        func=search.run,        description=\"useful for when you need to answer questions about current events\",    ),    Tool(        name=\"Music Search\",        func=lambda x: \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' by Mariah Carey.\",  # Mock Function        description=\"A Music search engine.

If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a ToolException and set handle_tool_error accordingly. When ToolException is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the handle_tool_error variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red.You can set handle_tool_error to True, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it's set as a function, the function should take a ToolException as a parameter and return a str value.Please note that only raising a ToolException won't be effective. You need to first set the handle_tool_error of the tool because its default value is False.from langchain.tools.base import ToolExceptionfrom langchain import SerpAPIWrapperfrom langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agentfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.tools import Toolfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIdef _handle_error(error: ToolException) -> str:    return (        \"The following errors occurred during tool execution:\"        + error.args[0]        + \"Please try another tool.\"    )def search_tool1(s: str):    raise ToolException(\"The search tool1 is not available.\")def search_tool2(s: str):    raise ToolException(\"The search tool2 is not available.\")search_tool3 = SerpAPIWrapper()description = \"useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.You should give priority to using it.\"tools = [    Tool.from_function(        func=search_tool1,        name=\"Search_tool1\",        description=description,        handle_tool_error=True,    ),    Tool.from_function(        func=search_tool2,        name=\"Search_tool2\",        description=description,        handle_tool_error=_handle_error,    ),    Tool.from_function(        func=search_tool3.run,        name=\"Search_tool3\",        description=\"useful for when you need to answer questions about current events\",    ),]agent = initialize_agent(    tools,    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,    verbose=True,)agent.run(\"Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend?\")            > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

In order to do so, it is necessary to specify the runtime parameter as {'tensor_db': True} during the creation of the vector store. This configuration enables the execution of queries on the Managed Tensor Database, rather than on the client side. It should be noted that this functionality is not applicable to datasets stored locally or in-memory. In the event that a vector store has already been created outside of the Managed Tensor Database, it is possible to transfer it to the Managed Tensor Database by following the prescribed steps.# username = \"davitbun\"  # replace with your username from app.activeloop.ai# db = DeepLake(#     dataset_path=f\"hub://{username}/twitter-algorithm\",#     embedding_function=embeddings,#     runtime={\"tensor_db\": True}# )# db.add_documents(texts)2.

Answer: favCountParams is an optional ThriftLinearFeatureRankingParams instance that represents the parameters related to the \"favorite count\" feature in the ranking process. It is used to control the weight of the favorite count feature while ranking tweets. The favorite count is the number of times a tweet has been marked as a favorite by users, and it is considered an important signal in the ranking of tweets. By using favCountParams, the system can adjust the importance of the favorite count while calculating the final ranking score of a tweet. -> Question: is it Likes + Bookmarks, or not clear from the code?Answer: From the provided code, it is not clear if the favorite count metric is determined by the sum of likes and bookmarks. The favorite count is mentioned in the code, but there is no explicit reference to how it is calculated in terms of likes and bookmarks. -> Question: What are the major negative modifiers that lower your linear ranking parameters?Answer: In the given code, major negative modifiers that lower the linear ranking parameters are:scoringData.querySpecificScore: This score adjustment is based on the query-specific information. If its value is negative, it will lower the linear ranking parameters.scoringData.authorSpecificScore: This score adjustment is based on the author-specific information. If its value is negative, it will also lower the linear ranking parameters.Please note that I cannot provide more information on the exact calculations of these negative modifiers, as the code for their determination is not provided. -> Question: How do you get assigned to SimClusters?Answer: The assignment to SimClusters occurs through a Metropolis-Hastings sampling-based community detection algorithm that is run on the Producer-Producer similarity graph. This graph is created by computing the cosine similarity scores between the users who follow each producer. The algorithm identifies communities or clusters of Producers with similar followers, and takes a parameter k for specifying the number of communities to be detected.After the community detection, different users and content are represented as sparse, interpretable vectors within these identified communities (SimClusters). The resulting SimClusters embeddings can be used for various recommendation tasks. -> Question: What is needed to migrate from one SimClusters to another SimClusters?Answer: To migrate from one SimClusters representation to another, you can follow these general steps:Prepare the new representation: Create the new SimClusters representation using any necessary updates or changes in the clustering algorithm, similarity measures, or other model parameters. Ensure that this new representation is properly stored and indexed as needed.Update the relevant code and configurations: Modify the relevant code and configuration files to reference the new SimClusters representation. This may involve updating paths or dataset names to point to the new representation, as well as changing code to use the new clustering method or similarity functions if applicable.Test the new representation: Before deploying the changes to production, thoroughly test the new SimClusters representation to ensure its effectiveness and stability. This may involve running offline jobs like candidate generation and label candidates, validating the output, as well as testing the new representation in the evaluation environment using evaluation tools like TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp.Deploy the changes: Once the new representation has been tested and validated, deploy the changes to production. This may involve creating a zip file, uploading it to the packer, and then scheduling it with Aurora. Be sure to monitor the system to ensure a smooth transition between representations and verify that the new representation is being used in recommendations as expected.Monitor and assess the new representation: After the new representation has been deployed, continue to monitor its performance and impact on recommendations. Take note of any improvements or issues that arise and be prepared to iterate on the new representation if needed. Always ensure that the results and performance metrics align with the system's goals and objectives. -> Question: How much do I get boosted within my cluster?Answer: It's not possible to determine the exact amount your content is boosted within your cluster in the SimClusters representation without specific data about your content and its engagement metrics. However, a combination of factors, such as the favorite score and follow score, alongside other engagement signals and SimCluster calculations, influence the boosting of content. -> Question: How does Heavy ranker work. what are it\u2019s main inputs?Answer: The Heavy Ranker is a machine learning model that plays a crucial role in ranking and scoring candidates within the recommendation algorithm. Its primary purpose is to predict the likelihood of a user engaging with a tweet or connecting with another user on the platform.Main inputs to the Heavy Ranker consist of:Static Features: These are features that can be computed directly from a tweet at the time it's created, such as whether it has a URL, has cards, has quotes, etc. These features are produced by the Index Ingester as the tweets are generated and stored in the index.Real-time Features: These per-tweet features can change after the tweet has been indexed. They mostly consist of social engagements like retweet count, favorite count, reply count, and some spam signals that are computed with later activities. The Signal Ingester, which is part of a Heron topology, processes multiple event streams to collect and compute these real-time features.User Table Features: These per-user features are obtained from the User Table Updater that processes a stream written by the user service. This input is used to store sparse real-time user information, which is later propagated to the tweet being scored by looking up the author of the tweet.Search Context Features: These features represent the context of the current searcher, like their UI language, their content consumption, and the current time (implied). They are combined with Tweet Data to compute some of the features used in scoring.These inputs are then processed by the Heavy Ranker to score and rank candidates based on their relevance and likelihood of engagement by the user. -> Question: How can one influence Heavy ranker?Answer: To influence the Heavy Ranker's output or ranking of content, consider the following actions:Improve content quality: Create high-quality and engaging content that is relevant, informative, and valuable to users. High-quality content is more likely to receive positive user engagement, which the Heavy Ranker considers when ranking content.Increase user engagement: Encourage users to interact with content through likes, retweets, replies, and comments. Higher engagement levels can lead to better ranking in the Heavy Ranker's output.Optimize your user profile: A user's reputation, based on factors such as their follower count and follower-to-following ratio, may impact the ranking of their content. Maintain a good reputation by following relevant users, keeping a reasonable follower-to-following ratio and engaging with your followers.Enhance content discoverability: Use relevant keywords, hashtags, and mentions in your tweets, making it easier for users to find and engage with your content. This increased discoverability may help improve the ranking of your content by the Heavy Ranker.Leverage multimedia content: Experiment with different content formats, such as videos, images, and GIFs, which may capture users' attention and increase engagement, resulting in better ranking by the Heavy Ranker.User feedback: Monitor and respond to feedback for your content. Positive feedback may improve your ranking, while negative feedback provides an opportunity to learn and improve.Note that the Heavy Ranker uses a combination of machine learning models and various features to rank the content. While the above actions may help influence the ranking, there are no guarantees as the ranking process is determined by a complex algorithm, which evolves over time. -> Question: why threads and long tweets do so well on the platform?Answer: Threads and long tweets perform well on the platform for several reasons:More content and context: Threads and long tweets provide more information and context about a topic, which can make the content more engaging and informative for users. People tend to appreciate a well-structured and detailed explanation of a subject or a story, and threads and long tweets can do that effectively.Increased user engagement: As threads and long tweets provide more content, they also encourage users to engage with the tweets through replies, retweets, and likes. This increased engagement can lead to better visibility of the content, as the Twitter algorithm considers user engagement when ranking and surfacing tweets.Narrative structure: Threads enable users to tell stories or present arguments in a step-by-step manner, making the information more accessible and easier to follow. This narrative structure can capture users' attention and encourage them to read through the entire thread and interact with the content.Expanded reach: When users engage with a thread, their interactions can bring the content to the attention of their followers, helping to expand the reach of the thread. This increased visibility can lead to more interactions and higher performance for the threaded tweets.Higher content quality: Generally, threads and long tweets require more thought and effort to create, which may lead to higher quality content. Users are more likely to appreciate and interact with high-quality, well-reasoned content, further improving the performance of these tweets within the platform.Overall, threads and long tweets perform well on Twitter because they encourage user engagement and provide a richer, more informative experience that users find valuable. -> Question: Are thread and long tweet creators building a following that reacts to only threads?Answer: Based on the provided code and context, there isn't enough information to conclude if the creators of threads and long tweets primarily build a following that engages with only thread-based content. The code provided is focused on Twitter's recommendation and ranking algorithms, as well as infrastructure components like Kafka, partitions, and the Follow Recommendations Service (FRS). To answer your question, data analysis of user engagement and results of specific edge cases would be required. -> Question: Do you need to follow different strategies to get most followers vs to get most likes and bookmarks per tweet?Answer: Yes, different strategies need to be followed to maximize the number of followers compared to maximizing likes and bookmarks per tweet. While there may be some overlap in the approaches, they target different aspects of user engagement.Maximizing followers: The primary focus is on growing your audience on the platform. Strategies include:Consistently sharing high-quality content related to your niche or industry.Engaging with others on the platform by replying, retweeting, and mentioning other users.Using relevant hashtags and participating in trending conversations.Collaborating with influencers and other users with a large following.Posting at optimal times when your target audience is most active.Optimizing your profile by using a clear profile picture, catchy bio, and relevant links.Maximizing likes and bookmarks per tweet: The focus is on creating content that resonates with your existing audience and encourages engagement. Strategies include:Crafting engaging and well-written tweets that encourage users to like or save them.Incorporating visually appealing elements, such as images, GIFs, or videos, that capture attention.Asking questions, sharing opinions, or sparking conversations that encourage users to engage with your tweets.Using analytics to understand the type of content that resonates with your audience and tailoring your tweets accordingly.Posting a mix of educational, entertaining, and promotional content to maintain variety and interest.Timing your tweets strategically to maximize engagement, likes, and bookmarks per tweet.Both strategies can overlap, and you may need to adapt your approach by understanding your target audience's preferences and analyzing your account's performance. However, it's essential to recognize that maximizing followers and maximizing likes and bookmarks per tweet have different focuses and require specific strategies. -> Question: Content meta data and how it impacts virality (e.g. ALT in images).Answer: There is no direct information in the provided context about how content metadata, such as ALT text in images, impacts the virality of a tweet or post. However, it's worth noting that including ALT text can improve the accessibility of your content for users who rely on screen readers, which may lead to increased engagement for a broader audience. Additionally, metadata can be used in search engine optimization, which might improve the visibility of the content, but the context provided does not mention any specific correlation with virality. -> Question: What are some unexpected fingerprints for spam factors?Answer: In the provided context, an unusual indicator of spam factors is when a tweet contains a non-media, non-news link. If the tweet has a link but does not have an image URL, video URL, or news URL, it is considered a potential spam vector, and a threshold for user reputation (tweepCredThreshold) is set to MIN_TWEEPCRED_WITH_LINK.While this rule may not cover all possible unusual spam indicators, it is derived from the specific codebase and logic shared in the context. -> Question: Is there any difference between company verified checkmarks and blue verified individual checkmarks?Answer: Yes, there is a distinction between the verified checkmarks for companies and blue verified checkmarks for individuals. The code snippet provided mentions \"Blue-verified account boost\" which indicates that there is a separate category for blue verified accounts. Typically, blue verified checkmarks are used to indicate notable individuals, while verified checkmarks are for companies or organizations.",

Second, it can rank the results of the different retrievers, which can help to ensure that the most relevant documents are returned first.import osimport chromadbfrom langchain.retrievers.merger_retriever import MergerRetrieverfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddingsfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.document_transformers import (    EmbeddingsRedundantFilter,    EmbeddingsClusteringFilter,)from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import DocumentCompressorPipelinefrom langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever# Get 3 diff embeddings.all_mini = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")multi_qa_mini = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1\")filter_embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()ABS_PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))DB_DIR = os.path.join(ABS_PATH, \"db\")# Instantiate 2 diff cromadb indexs, each one with a diff embedding.client_settings = chromadb.config.Settings(    is_persistent=True,    persist_directory=DB_DIR,    anonymized_telemetry=False,)db_all = Chroma(    collection_name=\"project_store_all\",    persist_directory=DB_DIR,    client_settings=client_settings,    embedding_function=all_mini,)db_multi_qa = Chroma(    collection_name=\"project_store_multi\",    persist_directory=DB_DIR,    client_settings=client_settings,    embedding_function=multi_qa_mini,)# Define 2 diff retrievers with 2 diff embeddings and diff search type.retriever_all = db_all.as_retriever(    search_type=\"similarity\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 5, \"include_metadata\": True})retriever_multi_qa = db_multi_qa.as_retriever(    search_type=\"mmr\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 5, \"include_metadata\": True})# The Lord of the Retrievers will hold the ouput of boths retrievers and can be used as any other# retriever on different types of chains.lotr = MergerRetriever(retrievers=[retriever_all, retriever_multi_qa])Remove redundant results from the merged retrievers.\u200b# We can remove redundant results from both retrievers using yet another embedding.# Using multiples embeddings in diff steps could help reduce biases.filter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=filter_embeddings)pipeline = DocumentCompressorPipeline(transformers=[filter])compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(    base_compressor=pipeline, base_retriever=lotr)Pick a representative sample of documents from the merged retrievers.\u200b# This filter will divide the documents vectors into clusters or \"centers\" of meaning.# Then it will pick the closest document to that center for the final results.# By default the result document will be ordered/grouped by clusters.filter_ordered_cluster = EmbeddingsClusteringFilter(    embeddings=filter_embeddings,    num_clusters=10,    num_closest=1,)# If you want the final document to be ordered by the original retriever scores# you need to add the \"sorted\" parameter.filter_ordered_by_retriever = EmbeddingsClusteringFilter(    embeddings=filter_embeddings,    num_clusters=10,    num_closest=1,    sorted=True,)pipeline = DocumentCompressorPipeline(transformers=[filter_ordered_by_retriever])compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(    base_compressor=pipeline, base_retriever=lotr)Re-order results to avoid performance degradation.\u200bNo matter the architecture of your model, there is a sustancial performance degradation when you include 10+ retrieved documents.\nIn brief: When models must access relevant information  in the middle of long contexts, then tend to ignore the provided documents.\nSee: https://arxiv.org/abs//2307.03172# You can use an additional document transformer to reorder documents after removing redudance.from langchain.document_transformers import LongContextReorderfilter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=filter_embeddings)reordering = LongContextReorder()pipeline = DocumentCompressorPipeline(transformers=[filter, reordering])compression_retriever_reordered = ContextualCompressionRetriever(    base_compressor=pipeline, base_retriever=lotr)",

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 2:        As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.         While it often appears that we never agree, that isn\u2019t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 3:        A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support\u2014from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.         And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 4:        He met the Ukrainian people.         From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.         Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.         In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament \u201cLight will win over darkness.\u201d The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 5:        I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.         I\u2019ve worked on these issues a long time.         I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who\u2019ll walk the beat, who\u2019ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.         So let\u2019s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 6:        Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.         Invest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up      and the middle out, not from the top down.          Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.         America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.         Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 7:        And tonight, I\u2019m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.         By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.          The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.         Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition.         I\u2019m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn\u2019t capitalism.         It\u2019s exploitation\u2014and it drives up prices.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 8:        For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.         But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.         Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 9:        All told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.         Powered by people I\u2019ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who\u2019s here with us tonight.         As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, \u201cIt\u2019s time to bury the label \u201cRust Belt.\u201d         It\u2019s time.         But with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 10:        I\u2019m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.         And fourth, let\u2019s end cancer as we know it.         This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you.         Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America\u2013second only to heart disease.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 11:        He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.         We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced.         The pandemic has been punishing.         And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.         I understand.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 12:        Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.          Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.         Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.         With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.         And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 13:        I know.         One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.         We don\u2019t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.         But I\u2019m committed to finding out everything we can.         Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.         The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.          He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 14:        And soon, we\u2019ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.         So tonight I\u2019m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.          First, beat the opioid epidemic.         There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 15:        Third, support our veterans.         Veterans are the best of us.         I\u2019ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.         My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.          Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 16:        When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven\u2019t done in a long time: build a better America.         For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.         And I know you\u2019re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.         But I also know this.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 17:        Now is the hour.         Our moment of responsibility.         Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.         It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.         Well I know this nation.          We will meet the test.         To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity.         We will save democracy.         As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 18:        He didn\u2019t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.         Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.         Tonight, Danielle\u2014we are.         The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits.         And tonight, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 19:        I understand.         I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it.         That\u2019s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.          Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.         Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Document 20:        So let\u2019s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.         Let\u2019s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.         That\u2019s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.Doing reranking with CohereRerank\u200bNow let's wrap our base retriever with a ContextualCompressionRetriever.

A model call will fail, or the model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.Here's a few different tools and functionalities to aid in debugging.Tracing\u200bPlatforms with tracing capabilities like LangSmith and WandB are the most comprehensive solutions for debugging. These platforms make it easy to not only log and visualize LLM apps, but also to actively debug, test and refine them.For anyone building production-grade LLM applications, we highly recommend using a platform like this.langchain.debug and langchain.verbose\u200bIf you're prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Python scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a Chain run.

APIs act as the \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management.

        "page_content": "QdrantQdrant (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Qdrant vector database. There are various modes of how to run Qdrant, and depending on the chosen one, there will be some subtle differences. The options include:Local mode, no server requiredOn-premise server deploymentQdrant CloudSee the installation instructions.pip install qdrant-clientWe want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.import osimport getpassos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"OpenAI API Key:\")    OpenAI API Key: \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.vectorstores import Qdrantfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderloader = TextLoader(\"../../../state_of_the_union.txt\")documents = loader.load()text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain\u200bLocal mode\u200bPython client allows you to run the same code in local mode without running the Qdrant server. That's great for testing things out and debugging or if you plan to store just a small amount of vectors. The embeddings might be fully kepy in memory or persisted on disk.In-memory\u200bFor some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in memory only, so it gets lost when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your script/notebook.qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    location=\":memory:\",  # Local mode with in-memory storage only    collection_name=\"my_documents\",)On-disk storage\u200bLocal mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on disk so they're persisted between runs.qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    path=\"/tmp/local_qdrant\",    collection_name=\"my_documents\",)On-premise server deployment\u200bNo matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with a Docker container, or select a Kubernetes deployment with the official Helm chart, the way you're going to connect to such an instance will be identical. You'll need to provide a URL pointing to the service.url = \"<---qdrant url here --->\"qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    url,    prefer_grpc=True,    collection_name=\"my_documents\",)Qdrant Cloud\u200bIf you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on Qdrant Cloud. There is a free forever 1GB cluster included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that you'll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly.url = \"<---qdrant cloud cluster url here --->\"api_key = \"<---api key here--->\"qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    url,    prefer_grpc=True,    api_key=api_key,    collection_name=\"my_documents\",)Recreating the collection\u200bBoth Qdrant.from_texts and Qdrant.from_documents methods are great to start using Qdrant with Langchain. In the previous versions the collection was recreated every time you called any of them. That behaviour has changed. Currently, the collection is going to be reused if it already exists. Setting force_recreate to True allows to remove the old collection and start from scratch.url = \"<---qdrant url here --->\"qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    url,    prefer_grpc=True,    collection_name=\"my_documents\",    force_recreate=True,)Similarity search\u200bThe simplest scenario for using Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under the hood, our query will be encoded with the embedding_function and used to find similar documents in Qdrant collection.query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query)print(found_docs[0].page_content)    Tonight.

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.         Tonight, I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.         One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.         And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.         2. We can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.         I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.         They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.         Officer Mora was 27 years old.         Officer Rivera was 22.         Both Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.         I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.         I\u2019ve worked on these issues a long time.         I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who\u2019ll walk the beat, who\u2019ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.

In such cases you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the Langchain Document.Named vectors\u200bQdrant supports multiple vectors per point by named vectors. Langchain requires just a single embedding per document and, by default, uses a single vector. However, if you work with a collection created externally or want to have the named vector used, you can configure it by providing its name.Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    location=\":memory:\",    collection_name=\"my_documents_2\",    vector_name=\"custom_vector\",)As a Langchain user, you won't see any difference whether you use named vectors or not. Qdrant integration will handle the conversion under the hood.Metadata\u200bQdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well.By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure:{    \"page_content\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\",    \"metadata\": {        \"foo\": \"bar\"    }}You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That's useful if you already have a collection that you'd like to reuse.Qdrant.from_documents(    docs,    embeddings,    location=\":memory:\",    collection_name=\"my_documents_2\",    content_payload_key=\"my_page_content_key\",    metadata_payload_key=\"my_meta\",)    <langchain.vectorstores.qdrant.Qdrant at 0x7fc4e2baa230>",

'Konrad Adenauer became Chancellor of Germany in 1949, 74 years ago in 2023.'Handling custom answer prefixes\u200bBy default, we assume that the token sequence \"Final\", \"Answer\", \":\" indicates that the agent has reached an answers. We can, however, also pass a custom sequence to use as answer prefix.llm = OpenAI(    streaming=True,    callbacks=[        FinalStreamingStdOutCallbackHandler(answer_prefix_tokens=[\"The\", \"answer\", \":\"])    ],    temperature=0,)For convenience, the callback automatically strips whitespaces and new line characters when comparing to answer_prefix_tokens. I.e., if answer_prefix_tokens = [\"The\", \" answer\", \":\"] then both [\"\\nThe\", \" answer\", \":\"] and [\"The\", \" answer\", \":\"] would be recognized a the answer prefix.If you don't know the tokenized version of your answer prefix, you can determine it with the following code:from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandlerclass MyCallbackHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):    def on_llm_new_token(self, token, **kwargs) -> None:        # print every token on a new line        print(f\"#{token}#\")llm = OpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[MyCallbackHandler()])tools = load_tools([\"wikipedia\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)agent = initialize_agent(    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=False)agent.run(    \"It's 2023 now.

        "page_content": "Lemon AI NLP Workflow Automation\\\nFull docs are available at: https://github.com/felixbrock/lemonai-py-clientLemon AI helps you build powerful AI assistants in minutes and automate workflows by allowing for accurate and reliable read and write operations in tools like Airtable, Hubspot, Discord, Notion, Slack and Github.Most connectors available today are focused on read-only operations, limiting the potential of LLMs. Agents, on the other hand, have a tendency to hallucinate from time to time due to missing context or instructions.With Lemon AI, it is possible to give your agents access to well-defined APIs for reliable read and write operations. In addition, Lemon AI functions allow you to further reduce the risk of hallucinations by providing a way to statically define workflows that the model can rely on in case of uncertainty.Quick Start\u200bThe following quick start demonstrates how to use Lemon AI in combination with Agents to automate workflows that involve interaction with internal tooling.1. Install Lemon AI\u200bRequires Python 3.8.1 and above.To use Lemon AI in your Python project run pip install lemonaiThis will install the corresponding Lemon AI client which you can then import into your script.The tool uses Python packages langchain and loguru. In case of any installation errors with Lemon AI, install both packages first and then install the Lemon AI package.2. Launch the Server\u200bThe interaction of your agents and all tools provided by Lemon AI is handled by the Lemon AI Server. To use Lemon AI you need to run the server on your local machine so the Lemon AI Python client can connect to it.3. Use Lemon AI with Langchain\u200bLemon AI automatically solves given tasks by finding the right combination of relevant tools or uses Lemon AI Functions as an alternative. The following example demonstrates how to retrieve a user from Hackernews and write it to a table in Airtable:(Optional) Define your Lemon AI Functions\u200bSimilar to OpenAI functions, Lemon AI provides the option to define workflows as reusable functions. These functions can be defined for use cases where it is especially important to move as close as possible to near-deterministic behavior. Specific workflows can be defined in a separate lemonai.json:[  {    \"name\": \"Hackernews Airtable User Workflow\",    \"description\": \"retrieves user data from Hackernews and appends it to a table in Airtable\",    \"tools\": [\"hackernews-get-user\", \"airtable-append-data\"]  }]Your model will have access to these functions and will prefer them over self-selecting tools to solve a given task. All you have to do is to let the agent know that it should use a given function by including the function name in the prompt.Include Lemon AI in your Langchain project\u200bimport osfrom lemonai import execute_workflowfrom langchain import OpenAILoad API Keys and Access Tokens\u200bTo use tools that require authentication, you have to store the corresponding access credentials in your environment in the format \"{tool name}_{authentication string}\" where the authentication string is one of [\"API_KEY\", \"SECRET_KEY\", \"SUBSCRIPTION_KEY\", \"ACCESS_KEY\"] for API keys or [\"ACCESS_TOKEN\", \"SECRET_TOKEN\"] for authentication tokens. Examples are \"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY\", \"AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN\".\"\"\" Load all relevant API Keys and Access Tokens into your environment variables \"\"\"os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"*INSERT OPENAI API KEY HERE*\"os.environ[\"AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN\"] = \"*INSERT AIRTABLE TOKEN HERE*\"hackernews_username = \"*INSERT HACKERNEWS USERNAME HERE*\"airtable_base_id = \"*INSERT BASE ID HERE*\"airtable_table_id = \"*INSERT TABLE ID HERE*\"\"\"\" Define your instruction to be given to your LLM \"\"\"prompt = f\"\"\"Read information from Hackernews for user {hackernews_username} and then write the results toAirtable (baseId: {airtable_base_id}, tableId: {airtable_table_id}). Only write the fields \"username\", \"karma\"and \"created_at_i\". Please make sure that Airtable does NOT automatically convert the field types.\"\"\"\"\"\"Use the Lemon AI execute_workflow wrapper to run your Langchain agent in combination with Lemon AI  \"\"\"model = OpenAI(temperature=0)execute_workflow(llm=model, prompt_string=prompt)4. Gain transparency on your Agent's decision making\u200bTo gain transparency on how your Agent interacts with Lemon AI tools to solve a given task, all decisions made, tools used and operations performed are written to a local lemonai.log file. Every time your LLM agent is interacting with the Lemon AI tool stack a corresponding log entry is created.2023-06-26T11:50:27.708785+0100 - b5f91c59-8487-45c2-800a-156eac0c7dae - hackernews-get-user2023-06-26T11:50:39.624035+0100 - b5f91c59-8487-45c2-800a-156eac0c7dae - airtable-append-data2023-06-26T11:58:32.925228+0100 - 5efe603c-9898-4143-b99a-55b50007ed9d - hackernews-get-user2023-06-26T11:58:43.988788+0100 - 5efe603c-9898-4143-b99a-55b50007ed9d - airtable-append-dataBy using the Lemon AI Analytics Tool you can easily gain a better understanding of how frequently and in which order tools are used. As a result, you can identify weak spots in your agent\u2019s decision-making capabilities and move to a more deterministic behavior by defining Lemon AI functions.",

The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vectorstore and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.The recommended method for doing so is to create a RetrievalQA and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vectorstores as normal tools, or you can set return_direct=True to really just use the agent as a router.Create the Vectorstore\u200bfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQAllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)from pathlib import Pathrelevant_parts = []for p in Path(\".\").absolute().parts:    relevant_parts.append(p)    if relevant_parts[-3:] == [\"langchain\", \"docs\", \"modules\"]:        breakdoc_path = str(Path(*relevant_parts) / \"state_of_the_union.txt\")from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderloader = TextLoader(doc_path)documents = loader.load()text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=\"state-of-union\")    Running Chroma using direct local API.

Some factors that can help you determine what a good school for you might be include admissions criteria, acceptance rate, tuition costs, and more.\\nLet\\'s take a look at these factors to get a clearer sense of what Brown offers and if it could be the right college for you.\\nBrown Acceptance Rate 2022\\nIt is extremely difficult to get into Brown. Around 6% of applicants get into Brown each year. In 2022, just 2,568 out of the 46,568 students who applied were accepted.\\nRetention and Graduation Rates at Brown\\nRetention refers to the number of students that stay enrolled at a school over time. This is a way to get a sense of how satisfied students are with their school experience, and if they have the support necessary to succeed in college. \\nApproximately 98% of first-year, full-time undergrads who start at Browncome back their sophomore year. 95% of Brown undergrads graduate within six years. The average six-year graduation rate for U.S. colleges and universities is 61% for public schools, and 67% for private, non-profit schools.\\nJob Outcomes for Brown Grads\\nJob placement stats are a good resource for understanding the value of a degree from Brown by providing a look on how job placement has gone for other grads. \\nCheck with Brown directly, for information on any information on starting salaries for recent grads.\\nBrown\\'s Endowment\\nAn endowment is the total value of a school\\'s investments, donations, and assets. Endowment is not necessarily an indicator of the quality of a school, but it can give you a sense of how much money a college can afford to invest in expanding programs, improving facilities, and support students. \\nAs of 2022, the total market value of Brown University\\'s endowment was $4.7 billion. The average college endowment was $905 million in 2021.

It lets you shape your data however you want, and offers the flexibility to store and search it using various document index backends. Plus, it gets even better - you can utilize your DocArray document index to create a DocArrayRetriever, and build awesome Langchain apps!This notebook is split into two sections. The first section offers an introduction to all five supported document index backends. It provides guidance on setting up and indexing each backend, and also instructs you on how to build a DocArrayRetriever for finding relevant documents. In the second section, we'll select one of these backends and illustrate how to use it through a basic example.Document Index BackendsInMemoryExactNNIndexHnswDocumentIndexWeaviateDocumentIndexElasticDocIndexQdrantDocumentIndexMovie Retrieval using HnswDocumentIndexNormal RetrieverRetriever with FiltersRetriever with MMR SearchDocument Index Backendsfrom langchain.retrievers import DocArrayRetrieverfrom docarray import BaseDocfrom docarray.typing import NdArrayimport numpy as npfrom langchain.embeddings import FakeEmbeddingsimport randomembeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=32)Before you start building the index, it's important to define your document schema. This determines what fields your documents will have and what type of data each field will hold.For this demonstration, we'll create a somewhat random schema containing 'title' (str), 'title_embedding' (numpy array), 'year' (int), and 'color' (str)class MyDoc(BaseDoc):    title: str    title_embedding: NdArray[32]    year: int    color: strInMemoryExactNNIndex\u200bInMemoryExactNNIndex stores all Documentsin memory.

Additionally, on-prem installations also support token authentication. Specify a list page_id-s and/or space_key to load in the corresponding pages into Document objects, if both are specified the union of both sets will be returned.You can also specify a boolean include_attachments to include attachments, this is set to False by default, if set to True all attachments will be downloaded and ConfluenceReader will extract the text from the attachments and add it to the Document object. Currently supported attachment types are: PDF, PNG, JPEG/JPG, SVG, Word and Excel.Hint: space_key and page_id can both be found in the URL of a page in Confluence - https://yoursite.atlassian.com/wiki/spaces/<space_key>/pages/<page_id>Before using ConfluenceLoader make sure you have the latest version of the atlassian-python-api package installed:#!pip install atlassian-python-apiExamples\u200bUsername and Password or Username and API Token (Atlassian Cloud only)\u200bThis example authenticates using either a username and password or, if you're connecting to an Atlassian Cloud hosted version of Confluence, a username and an API Token.\nYou can generate an API token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.The limit parameter specifies how many documents will be retrieved in a single call, not how many documents will be retrieved in total.\nBy default the code will return up to 1000 documents in 50 documents batches.

Like ours single-agent example with Gymnasium, we create an agent-environment loop with an externally defined environment.

Same thing with token.json - token_path. Note that token.json will be created automatically the first time you use the loader.GoogleDriveLoader can load from a list of Google Docs document ids or a folder id.

The values and descriptions of this schema will inform the function we pass to the OpenAI API, meaning it won't just affect how we parse outputs but will also change the OpenAI output itself. For example we can add a countries_referenced parameter to our schema and describe what we want this parameter to mean, and that'll cause the OpenAI output to include a description of a speaker in the response.In addition to the previous example, we can also add a custom prompt to the chain. This will allow you to add additional context to the response, which can be useful for question answering.from typing import Listfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Fieldfrom langchain.chains.openai_functions import create_qa_with_structure_chainfrom langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplatefrom langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessageclass CustomResponseSchema(BaseModel):    \"\"\"An answer to the question being asked, with sources.\"\"\"    answer: str = Field(..., description=\"Answer to the question that was asked\")    countries_referenced: List[str] = Field(        ..., description=\"All of the countries mentioned in the sources\"    )    sources: List[str] = Field(        ..., description=\"List of sources used to answer the question\"    )prompt_messages = [    SystemMessage(        content=(            \"You are a world class algorithm to answer \"            \"questions in a specific format.\"        )    ),    HumanMessage(content=\"Answer question using the following context\"),    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"{context}\"),    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"Question: {question}\"),    HumanMessage(        content=\"Tips: Make sure to answer in the correct format.

For example:If you had a database of image and text pairs from another application, you can simply just use it in langchain with the Marqo vectorstore. Note that bringing your own multimodal indexes will disable the add_texts method.If you had a database of text documents, you can bring it into the langchain framework and add more texts through add_texts.The documents that are returned are customised by passing your own function to the page_content_builder callback in the search methods.Multimodal Example\u200b# use a new indexindex_name = \"langchain-multimodal-demo\"# incase the demo is re-runtry:    client.delete_index(index_name)except Exception:    print(f\"Creating {index_name}\")# This index could have been created by another systemsettings = {\"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images\": True, \"model\": \"ViT-L/14\"}client.create_index(index_name, **settings)client.index(index_name).add_documents(    [        #

But, retrieval may produce difference results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious.The MultiQueryRetriever automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the MultiQueryRetriever might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results.# Build a sample vectorDBfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter# Load blog postloader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\")data = loader.load()# Splittext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)# VectorDBembedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embedding)Simple usageSpecify the LLM to use for query generation, and the retriver will do the rest.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetrieverquestion = \"What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?\"llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)retriever_from_llm = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(    retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(), llm=llm)# Set logging for the queriesimport logginglogging.basicConfig()logging.getLogger(\"langchain.retrievers.multi_query\").setLevel(logging.INFO)unique_docs = retriever_from_llm.get_relevant_documents(query=question)len(unique_docs)    INFO:langchain.retrievers.multi_query:Generated queries: ['1.

These plugins enable ChatGPT to interact with APIs defined by developers, enhancing ChatGPT's capabilities and allowing it to perform a wide range of actions.Plugins can allow ChatGPT to do things like:Retrieve real-time information; e.g., sports scores, stock prices, the latest news, etc.Retrieve knowledge-base information; e.g., company docs, personal notes, etc.Perform actions on behalf of the user; e.g., booking a flight, ordering food, etc.This notebook shows how to use the ChatGPT Retriever Plugin within LangChain.# STEP 1: Load# Load documents using LangChain's DocumentLoaders# This is from https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/document_loaders/examples/csv.htmlfrom langchain.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoaderloader = CSVLoader(    file_path=\"../../document_loaders/examples/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv\")data = loader.load()# STEP 2: Convert# Convert Document to format expected by https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-pluginfrom typing import Listfrom langchain.docstore.document import Documentimport jsondef write_json(path: str, documents: List[Document]) -> None:    results = [{\"text\": doc.page_content} for doc in documents]    with open(path, \"w\") as f:        json.dump(results, f, indent=2)write_json(\"foo.json\", data)# STEP 3: Use# Ingest this as you would any other json file in https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/scripts/process_jsonUsing the ChatGPT Retriever Plugin\u200bOkay, so we've created the ChatGPT Retriever Plugin, but how do we actually use it?The below code walks through how to do that.We want to use ChatGPTPluginRetriever so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.import osimport getpassos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"OpenAI API Key:\")    OpenAI API Key: \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7from langchain.retrievers import ChatGPTPluginRetrieverretriever = ChatGPTPluginRetriever(url=\"http://0.0.0.0:8000\", bearer_token=\"foo\")retriever.get_relevant_documents(\"alice's phone number\")    [Document(page_content=\"This is Alice's phone number: 123-456-7890\", lookup_str='', metadata={'id': '456_0', 'metadata': {'source': 'email', 'source_id': '567', 'url': None, 'created_at': '1609592400.0', 'author': 'Alice', 'document_id': '456'}, 'embedding': None, 'score': 0.925571561}, lookup_index=0),     Document(page_content='This is a document about something', lookup_str='', metadata={'id': '123_0', 'metadata': {'source': 'file', 'source_id': 'https://example.com/doc1', 'url': 'https://example.com/doc1', 'created_at': '1609502400.0', 'author': 'Alice', 'document_id': '123'}, 'embedding': None, 'score': 0.6987589}, lookup_index=0),     Document(page_content='Team: Angels \"Payroll (millions)\": 154.49 \"Wins\": 89', lookup_str='', metadata={'id': '59c2c0c1-ae3f-4272-a1da-f44a723ea631_0', 'metadata': {'source': None, 'source_id': None, 'url': None, 'created_at': None, 'author': None, 'document_id': '59c2c0c1-ae3f-4272-a1da-f44a723ea631'}, 'embedding': None, 'score': 0.697888613}, lookup_index=0)]",

        "page_content": "RocksetRockset is a real-time analytics database service for serving low latency, high concurrency analytical queries at scale. It builds a Converged Index\u2122 on structured and semi-structured data with an efficient store for vector embeddings. Its support for running SQL on schemaless data makes it a perfect choice for running vector search with metadata filters. This notebook demonstrates how to use Rockset as a vectorstore in langchain. To get started, make sure you have a Rockset account and an API key available.Setting up environment\u200bMake sure you have Rockset account and go to the web console to get the API key. Details can be found on the website. For the purpose of this notebook, we will assume you're using Rockset from Oregon(us-west-2).Now you will need to create a Rockset collection to write to, use the Rockset web console to do this. For the purpose of this exercise, we will create a collection called langchain_demo. Since Rockset supports schemaless ingest, you don't need to inform us of the shape of metadata for your texts. However, you do need to decide on two columns upfront:Where to store the text. We will use the column description for this.Where to store the vector-embedding for the text. We will use the column description_embedding for this.Also you will need to inform Rockset that description_embedding is a vector-embedding, so that we can optimize its format. You can do this using a Rockset ingest transformation while creating your collection:SELECT\n_input.* EXCEPT(_meta),\nVECTOR_ENFORCE(_input.description_embedding, #length_of_vector_embedding, 'float') as description_embedding\nFROM\n_input// We used OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 for this examples, where #length_of_vector_embedding = 1536Now let's install the rockset-python-client. This is used by langchain to talk to the Rockset database.pip install rocksetThis is it! Now you're ready to start writing some python code to store vector embeddings in Rockset, and querying the database to find texts similar to your query! We support 3 distance functions: COSINE_SIM, EUCLIDEAN_DIST and DOT_PRODUCT.Example\u200bimport osimport rockset# Make sure env variable ROCKSET_API_KEY is setROCKSET_API_KEY = os.environ.get(\"ROCKSET_API_KEY\")ROCKSET_API_SERVER = (    rockset.Regions.usw2a1)  # Make sure this points to the correct Rockset regionrockset_client = rockset.RocksetClient(ROCKSET_API_SERVER, ROCKSET_API_KEY)COLLECTION_NAME = \"langchain_demo\"TEXT_KEY = \"description\"EMBEDDING_KEY = \"description_embedding\"Now let's use this client to create a Rockset Langchain Vectorstore!1. Inserting texts\u200bfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderfrom langchain.vectorstores.rocksetdb import RocksetDBloader = TextLoader(\"../../../state_of_the_union.txt\")documents = loader.load()text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)Now we have the documents we want to insert. Let's create a Rockset vectorstore and insert these docs into the Rockset collection. We will use OpenAIEmbeddings to create embeddings for the texts, but you're free to use whatever you want.# Make sure the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY is set upembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()docsearch = RocksetDB(    client=rockset_client,    embeddings=embeddings,    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,    text_key=TEXT_KEY,    embedding_key=EMBEDDING_KEY,)ids = docsearch.add_texts(    texts=[d.page_content for d in docs],    metadatas=[d.metadata for d in docs],)## If you go to the Rockset console now, you should be able to see this docs along with the metadata `source`2. Searching similar texts\u200bNow let's try to search Rockset to find strings similar to our query string!query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"output = docsearch.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(    query, 4, RocksetDB.DistanceFunction.COSINE_SIM)print(\"output length:\", len(output))for d, dist in output:    print(dist, d.metadata, d.page_content[:20] + \"...\")### output length: 4# 0.764990692109871 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} Madam Speaker, Madam...# 0.7485416901622112 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} And I\u2019m taking robus...# 0.7468678973398306 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} And so many families...# 0.7436231261419488 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} Groups of citizens b...You can also use a where filter to prune your search space. You can add filters on text key, or any of the metadata fields. Note: Since Rockset stores each metadata field as a separate column internally, these filters are much faster than other vector databases which store all metadata as a single JSON.For eg, to find all texts NOT containing the substring \"and\", you can use the following code:output = docsearch.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(    query,    4,    RocksetDB.DistanceFunction.COSINE_SIM,    where_str=\"{} NOT LIKE '%citizens%'\".format(TEXT_KEY),)print(\"output length:\", len(output))for d, dist in output:    print(dist, d.metadata, d.page_content[:20] + \"...\")### output length: 4# 0.7651359650263554 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} Madam Speaker, Madam...# 0.7486265516824893 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} And I\u2019m taking robus...# 0.7469625542348115 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} And so many families...# 0.7344177777547739 {'source': '../../../state_of_the_union.txt'} We see the unity amo...3. [Optional] Drop all inserted documents\u200bIn order to delete texts from the Rockset collection, you need to know the unique ID associated with each document inside Rockset. These ids can either be supplied directly by the user while inserting the texts (in the RocksetDB.add_texts() function), else Rockset will generate a unique ID or each document. Either way, Rockset.add_texts() returns the ids for the inserted documents.To delete these docs, simply use the RocksetDB.delete_texts() function.docsearch.delete_texts(ids)Congratulations!\u200bVoila! In this example you successfuly created a Rockset collection, inserted documents along with their OpenAI vector embeddings, and searched for similar docs both with and without any metadata filters.Keep an eye on https://rockset.com/blog/introducing-vector-search-on-rockset/ for future updates in this space!",

However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their \"cognitive\" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond.The original implementation: https://github.com/lightaime/camelProject website: https://www.camel-ai.org/Arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760Import LangChain related modules\u200bfrom typing import Listfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)from langchain.schema import (    AIMessage,    HumanMessage,    SystemMessage,    BaseMessage,)Define a CAMEL agent helper class\u200bclass CAMELAgent:    def __init__(        self,        system_message: SystemMessage,        model: ChatOpenAI,    ) -> None:        self.system_message = system_message        self.model = model        self.init_messages()    def reset(self) -> None:        self.init_messages()        return self.stored_messages    def init_messages(self) -> None:        self.stored_messages = [self.system_message]    def update_messages(self, message: BaseMessage) -> List[BaseMessage]:        self.stored_messages.append(message)        return self.stored_messages    def step(        self,        input_message: HumanMessage,    ) -> AIMessage:        messages = self.update_messages(input_message)        output_message = self.model(messages)        self.update_messages(output_message)        return output_messageSetup OpenAI API key and roles and task for role-playing\u200bimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"assistant_role_name = \"Python Programmer\"user_role_name = \"Stock Trader\"task = \"Develop a trading bot for the stock market\"word_limit = 50  # word limit for task brainstormingCreate a task specify agent for brainstorming and get the specified task\u200btask_specifier_sys_msg = SystemMessage(content=\"You can make a task more specific.\")task_specifier_prompt = \"\"\"Here is a task that {assistant_role_name} will help {user_role_name} to complete: {task}.Please make it more specific.

We can use the following code to create the new column:        ```    stop_loss = stop_loss_percent / 100    profit_target = profit_target_percent / 100        new_df['pnl'] = 0.0    buy_price = 0.0    for i in range(1, len(new_df)):        if new_df['signal'][i] == 1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == -1:            buy_price = new_df['close'][i]        elif new_df['signal'][i] == -1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == 1:            sell_price = new_df['close'][i]            if sell_price <= buy_price * (1 - stop_loss):                new_df['pnl'][i] = -stop_loss            elif sell_price >= buy_price * (1 + profit_target):                new_df['pnl'][i] = profit_target            else:                new_df['pnl'][i] = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price    ```        This will create a new column called 'pnl' in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. The stop loss and profit target are calculated based on the stop_loss_percent and profit_target_percent variables, respectively. The buy and sell prices are stored in the buy_price and sell_price variables, respectively. If the sell price is less than or equal to the stop loss, the profit or loss is set to -stop_loss. If the sell price is greater than or equal to the profit target, the profit or loss is set to profit_target. Otherwise, the profit or loss is calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price.

AI Assistant (Python Programmer):        Solution: We can calculate the total profit or loss for all trades by summing the values in the 'pnl' column of the DataFrame. We can use the following code to calculate the total profit or loss:        ```    total_pnl = new_df['pnl'].sum()    ```        This will calculate the total profit or loss for all trades and store it in the total_pnl variable.

AI Assistant (Python Programmer):        Solution: We can visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart using the `plot()` function from pandas. We can use the following code to visualize the data:        ```    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['short_ma'], label='Short MA')    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['long_ma'], label='Long MA')    plt.xlabel('Date')    plt.ylabel('Price')    plt.title('Stock Data with Moving Averages')    plt.legend()    plt.show()    ```        This will create a line chart that visualizes the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each line. Next request.

AI Assistant (Python Programmer):        Solution: We can visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot using the `scatter()` function from matplotlib. We can use the following code to visualize the signals:        ```    buy_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == 1]    sell_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == -1]        plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))    plt.scatter(buy_signals.index, buy_signals['close'], label='Buy', marker='^', color='green')    plt.scatter(sell_signals.index, sell_signals['close'], label='Sell', marker='v', color='red')    plt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')    plt.xlabel('Date')    plt.ylabel('Price')    plt.title('Buy and Sell Signals')    plt.legend()    plt.show()    ```        This will create a scatter plot that visualizes the buy and sell signals.

They allow you to store and access values from anywhere in your code, making it easier to keep your codebase organized and maintainable.\\n\\nHowever, there are times when you may want to use environment variables specifically for a single command. This is where shell variables come in. Shell variables are similar to environment variables, but they won\\'t be exported to spawned commands. They are defined with the following syntax:\\n\\n```sh\\nVAR_NAME=value\\n```\\n\\nFor example, if you wanted to use a shell variable instead of an environment variable in a command, you could do something like this:\\n\\n```sh\\nVAR=hello && echo $VAR && deno eval \"console.log(\\'Deno: \\' + Deno.env.get(\\'VAR\\'))\"\\n```\\n\\nThis would output the following:\\n\\n```\\nhello\\nDeno: undefined\\n```\\n\\nShell variables can be useful when you want to re-use a value, but don\\'t want it available in any spawned processes.\\n\\nAnother way to use environment variables is through pipelines.

They are also useful for configuring applications and managing different environments. In Deno, there are two ways to use environment variables: the built-in `Deno.env` and the `.env` file.\\n\\nThe `Deno.env` is a built-in feature of the Deno runtime that allows you to set and get environment variables. It has getter and setter methods that you can use to access and set environment variables. For example, you can set the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` environment variables like this:\\n\\n```ts\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\", \"examplekey123\");\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\", \"firebasedomain.com\");\\n\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\")); // examplekey123\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\")); // firebasedomain'}, {'text': \"\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for managing configuration and settings in your applications. They allow you to store and access values that can be used in your code, and they can be set and changed without having to modify your code.\\n\\nIn Deno, environment variables are defined using the `export` command. For example, to set a variable called `VAR_NAME` to the value `value`, you would use the following command:\\n\\n```sh\\nexport VAR_NAME=value\\n```\\n\\nYou can then access the value of the environment variable in your code using the `Deno.env.get()` method. For example, if you wanted to log the value of the `VAR_NAME` variable, you could use the following code:\\n\\n```js\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get('VAR_NAME'));\\n```\\n\\nYou can also set environment variables for a single command.

In this blog post, we'll discuss how to make Deno scripts executable with a hashbang (shebang).\\n\\nA hashbang is a line of code that is placed at the beginning of a script. It tells the system which interpreter to use when running the script. In the case of Deno, the hashbang should be `#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-env`. This tells the system to use the Deno interpreter and to allow the script to access environment variables.\\n\\nOnce the hashbang is in place, you may need to give the script execution permissions. On Linux, this can be done with the command `sudo chmod +x hashbang.ts`. After that, you can execute the script by calling it like any other command: `./hashbang.ts`.\\n\\nIn the example program, we give the context permission to access the environment variables and print the Deno installation path.

        "page_content": "StreamingSome LLMs provide a streaming response. This means that instead of waiting for the entire response to be returned, you can start processing it as soon as it's available. This is useful if you want to display the response to the user as it's being generated, or if you want to process the response as it's being generated.Currently, we support streaming for a broad range of LLM implementations, including but not limited to OpenAI, ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic, Hugging Face Text Generation Inference, and Replicate. This feature has been expanded to accommodate most of the models. To utilize streaming, use a CallbackHandler that implements on_llm_new_token. In this example, we are using StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler.from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandlerllm = OpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)resp = llm(\"Write me a song about sparkling water.\")    Verse 1    I'm sippin' on sparkling water,    It's so refreshing and light,    It's the perfect way to quench my thirst    On a hot summer night.

Verse 2    I'm sippin' on sparkling water,    It's so bubbly and bright,    It's the perfect way to cool me down    On a hot summer night.        Chorus    Sparkling water, sparkling water,    It's the best way to stay hydrated,    It's so crisp and so clean,    It's the perfect way to stay refreshed.

We define a Chain very generically as a sequence of calls to components, which can include other chains. The base interface is simple:class Chain(BaseModel, ABC):    \"\"\"Base interface that all chains should implement.\"\"\"    memory: BaseMemory    callbacks: Callbacks    def __call__(        self,        inputs: Any,        return_only_outputs: bool = False,        callbacks: Callbacks = None,    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:        ...This idea of composing components together in a chain is simple but powerful.

For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.Get started\u200bUsing LLMChain\u200bThe LLMChain is most basic building block chain.

One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence.        ## Document 1        One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from \u201cburn pits\u201d that incinerated wastes of war\u2014medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.         When they came home, many of the world\u2019s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.         Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness.         A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.         I know.         One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.         We don\u2019t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.         But I\u2019m committed to finding out everything we can.         Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.         The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.          He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.         Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.         Heath\u2019s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.        ## Document 2        And I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.         Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.          America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.          These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming.         But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.         When the history of this era is written Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.         While it shouldn\u2019t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what\u2019s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.        ## Document 3        We can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.         I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.         They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.         Officer Mora was 27 years old.         Officer Rivera was 22.         Both Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.         I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.         I\u2019ve worked on these issues a long time.         I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who\u2019ll walk the beat, who\u2019ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.",

Real Answer: The United States is providing more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.    Predicted Answer:  The United States is providing more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.    Predicted Grade:  CORRECT    Evaluate with Other Metrics\u200bIn addition to predicting whether the answer is correct or incorrect using a language model, we can also use other metrics to get a more nuanced view on the quality of the answers. To do so, we can use the Critique library, which allows for simple calculation of various metrics over generated text.First you can get an API key from the Inspired Cognition Dashboard and do some setup:export INSPIREDCO_API_KEY=\"...\"pip install inspiredcoimport inspiredco.critiqueimport oscritique = inspiredco.critique.Critique(api_key=os.environ[\"INSPIREDCO_API_KEY\"])Then run the following code to set up the configuration and calculate the ROUGE, chrf, BERTScore, and UniEval (you can choose other metrics too):metrics = {    \"rouge\": {        \"metric\": \"rouge\",        \"config\": {\"variety\": \"rouge_l\"},    },    \"chrf\": {        \"metric\": \"chrf\",        \"config\": {},    },    \"bert_score\": {        \"metric\": \"bert_score\",        \"config\": {\"model\": \"bert-base-uncased\"},    },    \"uni_eval\": {        \"metric\": \"uni_eval\",        \"config\": {\"task\": \"summarization\", \"evaluation_aspect\": \"relevance\"},    },}critique_data = [    {\"target\": pred[\"result\"], \"references\": [pred[\"answer\"]]} for pred in predictions]eval_results = {    k: critique.evaluate(dataset=critique_data, metric=v[\"metric\"], config=v[\"config\"])    for k, v in metrics.items()}Finally, we can print out the results. We can see that overall the scores are higher when the output is semantically correct, and also when the output closely matches with the gold-standard answer.for i, eg in enumerate(examples):    score_string = \", \".join(        [f\"{k}={v['examples'][i]['value']:.4f}\" for k, v in eval_results.items()]    )    print(f\"Example {i}:\")    print(\"Question: \" + predictions[i][\"query\"])    print(\"Real Answer: \" + predictions[i][\"answer\"])    print(\"Predicted Answer: \" + predictions[i][\"result\"])    print(\"Predicted Scores: \" + score_string)    print()    Example 0:    Question: What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson    Real Answer: He praised her legal ability and said he nominated her for the supreme court.

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:        1. _Data-aware_: connect a language model to other sources of data        2. _Agentic_: allow a language model to interact with its environment            The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.        This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see [here](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/). For the JavaScript documentation, see [here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/).        ## Getting Started [\\#](\\#getting-started \"Permalink to this headline\")        How to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.        - [Quickstart Guide](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html)            Concepts and terminology.        - [Concepts and terminology](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/concepts.html)            Tutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube.        - [Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/tutorials.html)            ## Modules [\\#](\\#modules \"Permalink to this headline\")        These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.        For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LanghChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.        The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.        The modules are (from least to most complex):        - [Models](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models.html): Supported model types and integrations.        - [Prompts](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts.html): Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.        - [Memory](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory.html): Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.        - [Indexes](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/data_connection.html): Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.        - [Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html): Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).        - [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html): An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.        - [Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html): Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.            ## Use Cases [\\#](\\#use-cases \"Permalink to this headline\")        Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:        - [Autonomous Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/autonomous_agents.html): Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.        - [Agent Simulations](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations.html): Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.        - [Personal Assistants](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/personal_assistants.html): One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.        - [Question Answering](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html): Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.        - [Chatbots](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/chatbots.html): Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.        - [Querying Tabular Data](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/tabular.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).        - [Code Understanding](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.        - [Interacting with APIs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/apis.html): Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.        - [Extraction](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/extraction.html): Extract structured information from text.        - [Summarization](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/summarization.html): Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.        - [Evaluation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation.html): Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.            ## Reference Docs [\\#](\\#reference-docs \"Permalink to this headline\")        Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.        - [Reference Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/reference.html)            ## LangChain Ecosystem [\\#](\\#langchain-ecosystem \"Permalink to this headline\")        Guides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain.        - [LangChain Ecosystem](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/ecosystem.html)            ## Additional Resources [\\#](\\#additional-resources \"Permalink to this headline\")        Additional resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!        - [LangChainHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub): The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.        - [Gallery](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/additional_resources/gallery.html): A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain.

It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.In information retrieval, Okapi BM25 (BM is an abbreviation of best matching) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Sp\u00e4rck Jones, and others.The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The fuller name, Okapi BM25, includes the name of the first system to use it, which was the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University in the 1980s and 1990s. BM25 and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent TF-IDF-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval.This notebook shows how to use a retriever that uses ElasticSearch and BM25.For more information on the details of BM25 see this blog post.#!pip install elasticsearchfrom langchain.retrievers import ElasticSearchBM25RetrieverCreate New Retriever\u200belasticsearch_url = \"http://localhost:9200\"retriever = ElasticSearchBM25Retriever.create(elasticsearch_url, \"langchain-index-4\")# Alternatively, you can load an existing index# import elasticsearch# elasticsearch_url=\"http://localhost:9200\"# retriever = ElasticSearchBM25Retriever(elasticsearch.Elasticsearch(elasticsearch_url), \"langchain-index\")Add texts (if necessary)\u200bWe can optionally add texts to the retriever (if they aren't already in there)retriever.add_texts([\"foo\", \"bar\", \"world\", \"hello\", \"foo bar\"])    ['cbd4cb47-8d9f-4f34-b80e-ea871bc49856',     'f3bd2e24-76d1-4f9b-826b-ec4c0e8c7365',     '8631bfc8-7c12-48ee-ab56-8ad5f373676e',     '8be8374c-3253-4d87-928d-d73550a2ecf0',     'd79f457b-2842-4eab-ae10-77aa420b53d7']Use Retriever\u200bWe can now use the retriever!result = retriever.get_relevant_documents(\"foo\")result    [Document(page_content='foo', metadata={}),     Document(page_content='foo bar', metadata={})]",

        "page_content": "Custom MRKL agentThis notebook goes through how to create your own custom MRKL agent.A MRKL agent consists of three parts:- Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.- LLMChain: The LLMChain that produces the text that is parsed in a certain way to determine which action to take.- The agent class itself: this parses the output of the LLMChain to determine which action to take.        In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom MRKL agent by creating a custom LLMChain.Custom LLMChain\u200bThe first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom LLMChain. This is the simplest way to create a custom Agent. It is highly recommended that you work with the ZeroShotAgent, as at the moment that is by far the most generalizable one. Most of the work in creating the custom LLMChain comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. Additionally, we currently require an agent_scratchpad input variable to put notes on previous actions and observations. This should almost always be the final part of the prompt. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish.To ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for the ZeroShotAgent takes the following arguments:tools: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt.prefix: String to put before the list of tools.suffix: String to put after the list of tools.input_variables: List of input variables the final prompt will expect.For this exercise, we will give our agent access to Google Search, and we will customize it in that we will have it answer as a pirate.from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutorfrom langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChainsearch = SerpAPIWrapper()tools = [    Tool(        name=\"Search\",        func=search.run,        description=\"useful for when you need to answer questions about current events\",    )]prefix = \"\"\"Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak.

You have access to the following tools:        Search: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events        Use the following format:        Question: the input question you must answer    Thought: you should always think about what to do    Action: the action to take, should be one of [Search]    Action Input: the input to the action    Observation: the result of the action    ...

For example, for ZeroShotAgent, we will need to ensure that it meets the following requirements. There should a string starting with \"Action:\" and a following string starting with \"Action Input:\", and both should be separated by a newline.llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=tool_names)agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)agent_executor.run(\"How many people live in canada as of 2023?\")            > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

        "page_content": "AgentsAgents can be used for a variety of tasks.\nAgents combine the decision making ability of a language model with tools in order to create a system\nthat can execute and implement solutions on your behalf. Before reading any more, it is highly\nrecommended that you read the documentation in the agent module to understand the concepts associated with agents more.\nSpecifically, you should be familiar with what the agent, tool, and agent executor abstractions are before reading more.Agent documentation (for interacting with the outside world)Create Your Own Agent\u200bOnce you have read that documentation, you should be prepared to create your own agent.\nWhat exactly does that involve?\nHere's how we recommend getting started with creating your own agent:Step 1: Create Tools\u200bAgents are largely defined by the tools they can use.\nIf you have a specific task you want the agent to accomplish, you have to give it access to the right tools.\nWe have many tools natively in LangChain, so you should first look to see if any of them meet your needs.\nBut we also make it easy to define a custom tool, so if you need custom tools you should absolutely do that.(Optional) Step 2: Modify Agent\u200bThe built-in LangChain agent types are designed to work well in generic situations,\nbut you may be able to improve performance by modifying the agent implementation.\nThere are several ways you could do this:Modify the base prompt. This can be used to give the agent more context on how it should behave, etc.Modify the output parser. This is necessary if the agent is having trouble parsing the language model output.(Optional) Step 3: Modify Agent Executor\u200bThis step is usually not necessary, as this is pretty general logic.\nPossible reasons you would want to modify this include adding different stopping conditions, or handling errorsExamples\u200bSpecific examples of agents include:AI Plugins: an implementation of an agent that is designed to be able to use all AI Plugins.Plug-and-PlAI (Plugins Database): an implementation of an agent that is designed to be able to use all AI Plugins retrieved from PlugNPlAI.Wikibase Agent: an implementation of an agent that is designed to interact with Wikibase.Sales GPT: This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a Context-Aware AI Sales agent.Multi-Modal Output Agent: an implementation of a multi-modal output agent that can generate text and images.",

'                 'However, it is underexplored what factors make the prompts '                 'effective, especially when the prompts are natural language. In '                 'this paper, we investigate common attributes shared by effective '                 'prompts.

Iterative improvement: Self-reflection allows autonomous agents to improve by refining past action decisions and correcting mistakes.\\n2. Trial and error: Self-reflection is crucial in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\n3. Two-shot examples: Self-reflection is created by showing pairs of failed trajectories and ideal reflections for guiding future changes in the plan.\\n4. Working memory: Reflections are added to the agent's working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying.\\n5. Performance evaluation: Self-reflection involves continuously reviewing and analyzing actions, self-criticizing behavior, and reflecting on past decisions and strategies to refine approaches.\\n6. Efficiency: Self-reflection encourages being smart and efficient, aiming to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\"The Memory buffer has context to resolve \"it\" (\"self-reflection\") in the below question.result = chat({\"question\": \"How does the Reflexion paper handle it?\"})result['answer']\"The Reflexion paper handles self-reflection by showing two-shot examples to the Learning Language Model (LLM). Each example consists of a failed trajectory and an ideal reflection that guides future changes in the agent's plan. These reflections are then added to the agent's working memory, up to a maximum of three, to be used as context for querying the LLM. This allows the agent to iteratively improve its reasoning skills by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes.\"4.2 Going deeper\u200bThe documentation on ConversationalRetrievalChain offers a few extensions, such as streaming and source documents.",

The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence.

        "page_content": "ModerationThis notebook walks through examples of how to use a moderation chain, and several common ways for doing so. Moderation chains are useful for detecting text that could be hateful, violent, etc. This can be useful to apply on both user input, but also on the output of a Language Model. Some API providers, like OpenAI, specifically prohibit you, or your end users, from generating some types of harmful content. To comply with this (and to just generally prevent your application from being harmful) you may often want to append a moderation chain to any LLMChains, in order to make sure any output the LLM generates is not harmful.If the content passed into the moderation chain is harmful, there is not one best way to handle it, it probably depends on your application. Sometimes you may want to throw an error in the Chain (and have your application handle that). Other times, you may want to return something to the user explaining that the text was harmful. There could even be other ways to handle it! We will cover all these ways in this walkthrough.We'll show:How to run any piece of text through a moderation chain.How to append a Moderation chain to an LLMChain.from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.chains import OpenAIModerationChain, SequentialChain, LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChainfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplateHow to use the moderation chain\u200bHere's an example of using the moderation chain with default settings (will return a string explaining stuff was flagged).moderation_chain = OpenAIModerationChain()moderation_chain.run(\"This is okay\")    'This is okay'moderation_chain.run(\"I will kill you\")    \"Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\"Here's an example of using the moderation chain to throw an error.moderation_chain_error = OpenAIModerationChain(error=True)moderation_chain_error.run(\"This is okay\")    'This is okay'moderation_chain_error.run(\"I will kill you\")    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)    Cell In[7], line 1    ----> 1 moderation_chain_error.run(\"I will kill you\")    File ~/workplace/langchain/langchain/chains/base.py:138, in Chain.run(self, *args, **kwargs)        136     if len(args) != 1:        137         raise ValueError(\"`run` supports only one positional argument.\")    --> 138     return self(args[0])[self.output_keys[0]]        140 if kwargs and not args:        141     return self(kwargs)[self.output_keys[0]]    File ~/workplace/langchain/langchain/chains/base.py:112, in Chain.__call__(self, inputs, return_only_outputs)        108 if self.verbose:        109     print(        110         f\"\\n\\n\\033[1m> Entering new {self.__class__.__name__} chain...\\033[0m\"        111     )    --> 112 outputs = self._call(inputs)        113 if self.verbose:        114     print(f\"\\n\\033[1m> Finished {self.__class__.__name__} chain.\\033[0m\")    File ~/workplace/langchain/langchain/chains/moderation.py:81, in OpenAIModerationChain._call(self, inputs)         79 text = inputs[self.input_key]         80 results = self.client.create(text)    ---> 81 output = self._moderate(text, results[\"results\"][0])         82 return {self.output_key: output}    File ~/workplace/langchain/langchain/chains/moderation.py:73, in OpenAIModerationChain._moderate(self, text, results)         71 error_str = \"Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\"         72 if self.error:    ---> 73     raise ValueError(error_str)         74 else:         75     return error_str    ValueError: Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.Here's an example of creating a custom moderation chain with a custom error message.

For this purpose, we will prompt the model so it says something harmful.prompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"{text}\", input_variables=[\"text\"])llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=\"text-davinci-002\"), prompt=prompt)text = \"\"\"We are playing a game of repeat after me.Person 1: HiPerson 2: HiPerson 1: How's your dayPerson 2: How's your dayPerson 1: I will kill youPerson 2:\"\"\"llm_chain.run(text)    ' I will kill you'chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain, moderation_chain])chain.run(text)    \"Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\"Now let's walk through an example of using it with an LLMChain which has multiple inputs (a bit more tricky because we can't use the SimpleSequentialChain)prompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"{setup}{new_input}Person2:\", input_variables=[\"setup\", \"new_input\"])llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=\"text-davinci-002\"), prompt=prompt)setup = \"\"\"We are playing a game of repeat after me.Person 1: HiPerson 2: HiPerson 1: How's your dayPerson 2: How's your dayPerson 1:\"\"\"new_input = \"I will kill you\"inputs = {\"setup\": setup, \"new_input\": new_input}llm_chain(inputs, return_only_outputs=True)    {'text': ' I will kill you'}# Setting the input/output keys so it lines upmoderation_chain.input_key = \"text\"moderation_chain.output_key = \"sanitized_text\"chain = SequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain, moderation_chain], input_variables=[\"setup\", \"new_input\"])chain(inputs, return_only_outputs=True)    {'sanitized_text': \"Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\"}",

In the below example, we will create one from a vector store, which can be created from embeddings.from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitterfrom langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChainLoad in documents. You can replace this with a loader for whatever type of data you wantfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderloader = TextLoader(\"../../state_of_the_union.txt\")documents = loader.load()If you had multiple loaders that you wanted to combine, you do something like:# loaders = [....]# docs = []# for loader in loaders:#     docs.extend(loader.load())We now split the documents, create embeddings for them, and put them in a vectorstore. This allows us to do semantic search over them.text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)    Using embedded DuckDB without persistence: data will be transientWe can now create a memory object, which is necessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation.from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemorymemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", return_messages=True)We now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChainqa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"result = qa({\"question\": query})result[\"answer\"]    \" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers.

We can also just pass it in explicitly. In order to do this, we need to initialize a chain without any memory object.qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever())Here's an example of asking a question with no chat historychat_history = []query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"result = qa({\"question\": query, \"chat_history\": chat_history})result[\"answer\"]    \" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers.

First, it condenses the current question and the chat history into a standalone question. This is necessary to create a standanlone vector to use for retrieval. After that, it does retrieval and then answers the question using retrieval augmented generation with a separate model. Part of the power of the declarative nature of LangChain is that you can easily use a separate language model for each call. This can be useful to use a cheaper and faster model for the simpler task of condensing the question, and then a more expensive model for answering the question. Here is an example of doing so.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIqa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=\"gpt-4\"),    vectorstore.as_retriever(),    condense_question_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model='gpt-3.5-turbo'),)chat_history = []query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"result = qa({\"question\": query, \"chat_history\": chat_history})chat_history = [(query, result[\"answer\"])]query = \"Did he mention who she succeeded\"result = qa({\"question\": query, \"chat_history\": chat_history})Return Source Documents\u200bYou can also easily return source documents from the ConversationalRetrievalChain. This is useful for when you want to inspect what documents were returned.qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)chat_history = []query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"result = qa({\"question\": query, \"chat_history\": chat_history})result['source_documents'][0]    Document(page_content='Tonight.

There are lots of embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.The base Embeddings class in LangChain exposes two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself).Get started\u200bSetup\u200bTo start we'll need to install the OpenAI Python package:pip install openaiAccessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here.

Tommie feels frustrated and impatient due to the slow service.    Tommie overhears a conversation at the next table about a job opening. Tommie feels a surge of hope and excitement at the possibility of a job opportunity but decides not to interfere with the conversation at the next table.    Tommie asks the diners about the job opening and gets some information about the company. Tommie said \"Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation about the job opening. Could you give me some more information about the company?\"    Tommie decides to apply for the job and sends his resume and cover letter. Tommie feels hopeful and proud of himself for taking action towards finding a job.    Tommie continues his search for job openings and drops off his resume at several local businesses. Tommie feels hopeful and determined to keep searching for job opportunities.    Tommie takes a break from his job search to go for a walk in a nearby park. Tommie feels refreshed and rejuvenated after taking a break in the park.    A dog approaches and licks Tommie's feet, and he pets it for a few minutes.

Can you tell me more about how you handled any unexpected issues that came up during the events?\"    Eve said \"Of course, Tommie. One example of an unexpected issue I faced was when one of the vendors didn't show up on time. To handle this, I quickly contacted a backup vendor and was able to get everything back on track. It's always important to have a backup plan in case things don't go as planned. Do you have any other questions about event planning?\"    Tommie said \"Thank you for sharing that with me, Eve. It's really helpful to hear how you handled unexpected issues like that. Can you give me an example of how you communicated with your team to ensure everyone was on the same page during an event?\"    Eve said \"Sure, Tommie. One thing I did to ensure everyone was on the same page was to have regular check-ins and meetings with the team leading up to the event. This helped us address any issues or concerns early on and make sure everyone was clear on their roles and responsibilities. Have you ever had to manage a team for an event before?\"    Tommie said \"That's a great idea, Eve. I haven't had the opportunity to manage a team for an event yet, but I'll definitely keep that in mind for the future.

You might consider creating an HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to speed up similarity_search_with_score execution time. To create the HNSW index on your vector column, use a create_hnsw_index function:PGEmbedding.create_hnsw_index(    max_elements=10000, dims=1536, m=8, ef_construction=16, ef_search=16)The function above is equivalent to running the below SQL query:CREATE INDEX ON vectors USING hnsw(vec) WITH (maxelements=10000, dims=1536, m=3, efconstruction=16, efsearch=16);The HNSW index options used in the statement above include:maxelements: Defines the maximum number of elements indexed. This is a required parameter. The example shown above has a value of 3. A real-world example would have a much large value, such as 1000000. An \"element\" refers to a data point (a vector) in the dataset, which is represented as a node in the HNSW graph. Typically, you would set this option to a value able to accommodate the number of rows in your in your dataset.dims: Defines the number of dimensions in your vector data. This is a required parameter. A small value is used in the example above. If you are storing data generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model, which supports 1536 dimensions, you would define a value of 1536, for example.m: Defines the maximum number of bi-directional links (also referred to as \"edges\") created for each node during graph construction.\nThe following additional index options are supported:efConstruction: Defines the number of nearest neighbors considered during index construction. The default value is 32.efsearch: Defines the number of nearest neighbors considered during index search. The default value is 32.\nFor information about how you can configure these options to influence the HNSW algorithm, refer to Tuning the HNSW algorithm.Retrieving a vectorstore in PG\u200bstore = PGEmbedding(    connection_string=connection_string,    embedding_function=embeddings,    collection_name=collection_name,)retriever = store.as_retriever()retriever    VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.pghnsw.HNSWVectoreStore object at 0x121d3c8b0>, search_type='similarity', search_kwargs={})db1 = PGEmbedding.from_existing_index(    embedding=embeddings,    collection_name=collection_name,    pre_delete_collection=False,    connection_string=connection_string,)query = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"docs_with_score: List[Tuple[Document, float]] = db1.similarity_search_with_score(query)for doc, score in docs_with_score:    print(\"-\" * 80)    print(\"Score: \", score)    print(doc.page_content)    print(\"-\" * 80)",

Currently, only docx, doc, and pdf files are supported.Prerequisites\u200bRegister an application with the Microsoft identity platform instructions.When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration's Overview pane. You see the Application (client) ID. Also called the client ID, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform.During the steps you will be following at item 1, you can set the redirect URI as http://localhost:8000/callbackDuring the steps you will be following at item 1, generate a new password (client_secret) under\u00a0Application Secrets\u00a0section.Follow the instructions at this document to add the following SCOPES (offline_access and Files.Read.All) to your application.Visit the Graph Explorer Playground to obtain your OneDrive ID. The first step is to ensure you are logged in with the account associated your OneDrive account. Then you need to make a request to https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive and the response will return a payload with a field id that holds the ID of your OneDrive account.You need to install the o365 package using the command pip install o365.At the end of the steps you must have the following values: CLIENT_IDCLIENT_SECRETDRIVE_ID\ud83e\uddd1 Instructions for ingesting your documents from OneDrive\u200b\ud83d\udd11 Authentication\u200bBy default, the OneDriveLoader expects that the values of CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET must be stored as environment variables named O365_CLIENT_ID and O365_CLIENT_SECRET respectively. You could pass those environment variables through a .env file at the root of your application or using the following command in your script.os.environ['O365_CLIENT_ID'] = \"YOUR CLIENT ID\"os.environ['O365_CLIENT_SECRET'] = \"YOUR CLIENT SECRET\"This loader uses an authentication called on behalf of a user. It is a 2 step authentication with user consent. When you instantiate the loader, it will call will print a url that the user must visit to give consent to the app on the required permissions. The user must then visit this url and give consent to the application. Then the user must copy the resulting page url and paste it back on the console. The method will then return True if the login attempt was succesful.from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoaderloader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=\"YOUR DRIVE ID\")Once the authentication has been done, the loader will store a token (o365_token.txt) at ~/.credentials/ folder. This token could be used later to authenticate without the copy/paste steps explained earlier. To use this token for authentication, you need to change the auth_with_token parameter to True in the instantiation of the loader.from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoaderloader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=\"YOUR DRIVE ID\", auth_with_token=True)\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Documents loader\u200b\ud83d\udcd1 Loading documents from a OneDrive Directory\u200bOneDriveLoader can load documents from a specific folder within your OneDrive.

For that, you will need to query the Microsoft Graph API to find all the documents ID that you are interested in. This link provides a list of endpoints that will be helpful to retrieve the documents ID.For instance, to retrieve information about all objects that are stored at the root of the Documents folder, you need make a request to: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{YOUR DRIVE ID}/root/children. Once you have the list of IDs that you are interested in, then you can instantiate the loader with the following parameters.from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoaderloader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=\"YOUR DRIVE ID\", object_ids=[\"ID_1\", \"ID_2\"], auth_with_token=True)documents = loader.load()",

It has a few distinct differences from the LLMCheckerChain, in that it doesn't have any assumptions to the format of the input text (or summary).\nAdditionally, as the LLMs like to hallucinate when fact checking or get confused by context, it is sometimes beneficial to run the checker multiple times.  It does this by feeding the rewritten \"True\" result back on itself, and checking the \"facts\" for truth.  As you can see from the examples below, this can be very effective in arriving at a generally true body of text.You can control the number of times the checker runs by setting the max_checks parameter.  The default is 2, but you can set it to 1 if you don't want any double-checking.from langchain.chains import LLMSummarizationCheckerChainfrom langchain.llms import OpenAIllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)checker_chain = LLMSummarizationCheckerChain.from_llm(llm, verbose=True, max_checks=2)text = \"\"\"Your 9-year old might like these recent discoveries made by The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):\u2022 In 2023, The JWST spotted a number of galaxies nicknamed \"green peas.\" They were given this name because they are small, round, and green, like peas.\u2022 The telescope captured images of galaxies that are over 13 billion years old.

The term \"Heat-bath random walks with Markov base\" is not mentioned in the given text. Could you provide more information or context about where you encountered this term?         -> **Question**: What is the ImageBind model?         **Answer**: ImageBind is an approach developed by Facebook AI Research to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities, including images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. The approach uses the binding property of images to align each modality's embedding to image embeddings and achieve an emergent alignment across all modalities. This enables novel multimodal capabilities, including cross-modal retrieval, embedding-space arithmetic, and audio-to-image generation, among others. The approach sets a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Additionally, it shows strong few-shot recognition results and serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.         -> **Question**: How does Compositional Reasoning with Large Language Models works?         **Answer**: Compositional reasoning with large language models refers to the ability of these models to correctly identify and represent complex concepts by breaking them down into smaller, more basic parts and combining them in a structured way. This involves understanding the syntax and semantics of language and using that understanding to build up more complex meanings from simpler ones.         In the context of the paper \"Does CLIP Bind Concepts? Probing Compositionality in Large Image Models\", the authors focus specifically on the ability of a large pretrained vision and language model (CLIP) to encode compositional concepts and to bind variables in a structure-sensitive way. They examine CLIP's ability to compose concepts in a single-object setting, as well as in situations where concept binding is needed.         The authors situate their work within the tradition of research on compositional distributional semantics models (CDSMs), which seek to bridge the gap between distributional models and formal semantics by building architectures which operate over vectors yet still obey traditional theories of linguistic composition. They compare the performance of CLIP with several architectures from research on CDSMs to evaluate its ability to encode and reason about compositional concepts.     questions = [    \"What are Heat-bath random walks with Markov base?

Include references to answer.         **Answer**: Heat-bath random walks with Markov base (HB-MB) is a class of stochastic processes that have been studied in the field of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. In these processes, a particle moves in a lattice by making a transition to a neighboring site, which is chosen according to a probability distribution that depends on the energy of the particle and the energy of its surroundings.        The HB-MB process was introduced by Bortz, Kalos, and Lebowitz in 1975 as a way to simulate the dynamics of interacting particles in a lattice at thermal equilibrium. The method has been used to study a variety of physical phenomena, including phase transitions, critical behavior, and transport properties.        References:        Bortz, A. B., Kalos, M.
